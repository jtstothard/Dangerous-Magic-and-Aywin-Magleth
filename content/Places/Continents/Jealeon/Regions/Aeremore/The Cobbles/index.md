The Cobbles is a neighbourhood of Aeremore located outside Magleth Manor. It is mentioned in session notes as the apparent residence of Mary Finsworth — later revealed to be an illusion or construct used by Aywin Magleth to contact the party.

Facts extracted from sessions and pages:

- Appears in investigations concerning stolen architectural plans that referenced Magleth Manor (see [[Notes/Session 12|Session 12]] and [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/Buildings/Magleth Manor|Magleth Manor]]).
- Mary Finsworth, presented as a halfling baker in The Cobbles, was in fact an illusion/construct maintained by [[People/NPCs/Legendary/Aywin Magleth|Aywin Magleth]] and served as a contact conduit for the party.
- The Cobbles is explicitly referenced from multiple NPC and region pages; create additional local records (maps, merchant lists) when available.
