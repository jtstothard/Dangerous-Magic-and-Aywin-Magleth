### **Town Summary**

**Cerbereburn** is a small town with rural roots and simmering local tensions, currently in lockdown due to the recent murder of its lawmaster. It appears peaceful at first glance but is rife with political conflict, land disputes, and a general distrust of outsiders.

### **Notable Locations:**

- **The Owlbear Cub Tavern** – A central gathering place for locals and travelers alike. Run by a big, burly minotaur barkeep (they/them). Serves as the party's initial meeting point.
- **Mallone Ulaxidor’s Home** – Lawmaster’s house, modest and orderly. No signs of struggle, but his diary provides crucial insight into the town's political tensions.
- **Blacksmith (Bertrum Greyson)** – Uses the river for forging; accused of polluting it by others.
- **Stables (Saria Tallbloom)** – Downstream from the forge, affected by river pollution.
