Penketh is recorded in party notes as the origin of an historical "soul-sucking" incident uncovered within the Cirrubi Central Bureaucracy's archives during the party's investigation (see [[Notes/Session 15|Session 15]]).

What is known (from session notes):

- A magically altered report in the Cirrubi archives referenced an old case tied to Penketh.
- The party uncovered only a brief reference to a "soul-sucking" case; no local records were attached to the archival file.
