A region within the continent of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/index|Jealeon]], known for its association with the Peace Domain and its recent conflict with neighbouring [[Loshium]].

## Overview

**Spuaburg** is one of the "peace nations" within [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/index|Jealeon]]. Despite its association with peace, the region recently concluded a war with [[Loshium]], demonstrating the complex nature of political relationships in the continent. The region is home to the religious group known as the "Peace Keepers", who worship [[Rainia, the Winged Harmoniser]].

## War with [[Loshium]]

The war with [[Loshium]] is not described as a religious conflict, but rather one for access to resources and trade routes. Spuaburg maintains a key position in the region controlling all of the continent's access to the ocean from the east, making it a strategically important area for trade and military movements.

According to Spuaburg accounts, [[Loshium]] forces initiated the conflict in an act described by the people of Spuaburg as an "act of terrorism". [[Loshium]] focused their efforts on reclaiming territory north of the canal on their border that previously belonged to them.

## Religious Significance

The Peace Keepers of Spuaburg are a religious group that worships [[Rainia, the Winged Harmoniser]]. They are known for their commitment to peace and diplomacy, although their recent military actions against [[Loshium]] suggest a more complex relationship with the concept of peace.

## Geography

Spuaburg is located on the eastern side of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/index|Jealeon]], providing strategic control over maritime access from the east. This geographical advantage has made it a focal point for trade and military movements, particularly during the recent conflict with [[Loshium]].
