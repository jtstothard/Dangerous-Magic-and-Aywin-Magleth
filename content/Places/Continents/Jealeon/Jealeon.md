**Jealeon** is a diverse continent featuring multiple regions with complex political relationships and ongoing tensions between neighbouring territories. It serves as the primary setting for our campaign adventures.

## Regional Overview

### [[Aeremore]]

The campaign's destination city, known as a center for magical learning and scholarship. Many adventurers and scholars travel here to study magic and uncover truths about the world.

### [[Aswesh|Aswesh]]

A region containing the town of [[Cerbereburn|Cerbereburn]]. Has strict border controls, checking all belongings of travellers' entering from other regions. Notable for political tensions with neighbouring [[Aswen]].

### [[Aswen]]

A neighbouring region to [[Aswesh|Aswesh]]. The two regions harbour deep animosity toward each other, though the specific reasons for their hatred remain unclear.

### [[Spuaburg]]

Home region of [[Lyra Shadowflame]], associated with the Peace Domain and the deity [[Rainia, the Winged Harmoniser]]. Recently ended a conflict with [[Loshium]], though this was not a religious war despite both regions having different divine associations.

### [[Loshium]]

A region associated with the Life domain and the deity [[Zurasus]]. Recently ended a conflict with [[Spuaburg]], characterised as a struggle between "Peace keepers vs Pacifiers."

### [[East Meashelles]] And [[West Meashelles]]

Formerly a single nation, these regions split due to financial disparity. The division represents economic tensions that have affected the continent's political landscape.

### [[Kespice]]

A coastal region that serves as a transit point for travellers. Contains port towns where travellers can find passage to other regions, though some vessels operating from here may be pirate ships in disguise.

## Political Climate

Jealeon is characterised by:

- **Regional rivalries**: Particularly between [[Aswesh|Aswesh]] and [[Aswen]]
- **Economic divisions**: The split of the Meashelles regions shows how financial disparity can divide formerly unified territories
- **Recent conflicts**: The war between [[Spuaburg]] and [[Loshium]] indicates ongoing tensions between different philosophical approaches to peace and healing
- **Border security**: Regions like [[Aswesh|Aswesh]] maintain strict border controls, suggesting concerns about security or smuggling
