## Background

Bear Cloudstripe is a reverse centaur—possessing a horse's head atop a human torso and legs—who lives in a farmhouse about a day's journey from [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cirrubi|Cirrubi]]. His unusual appearance explains [[People/NPCs/Legendary/Aywin Magleth|Aywin Magleth]]'s warning not to stare, as his form is startling enough to cause people to gape inappropriately.

Bear owes [[People/NPCs/Legendary/Aywin Magleth|Aywin Magleth]] a favour and as a result allows his home to serve as a teleportation point for the wizard's operations. The arrangement appears mutually beneficial: Bear receives magical assistance while Magleth gains a discreet travel hub away from the main city. Bear himself does not handle teleportation magic and warned visitors they would need to find their own way back to their destinations.
