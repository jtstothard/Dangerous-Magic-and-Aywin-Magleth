## Background

Mary Finsworth appeared to be an old halfling baker living in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/The Cobbles|The Cobbles]] who had architectural plans stolen from the [[Organisations/Cirrubi Central Bureaucracy|Cirrubi Central Bureaucracy]]. However, she was revealed to be an elaborate illusion or construct created by [[People/NPCs/Legendary/Aywin Magleth|Aywin Magleth]] to make contact with [[Organisations/Adventuring Parties/The Prime Suspects|The Prime Suspects]].

Her small house above a bakery appeared to be lived-in but showed inconsistencies, furniture wasn't worn despite apparent routine use, and she avoided physical contact. [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]]'s magical detection revealed she was completely suffused with illusion magic.
