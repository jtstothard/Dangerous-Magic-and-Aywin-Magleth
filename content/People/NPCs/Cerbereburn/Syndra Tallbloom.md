**Syndra Tallbloom** is the youngest member of the Tallbloom family, living at the Tallbloom Home with her mother [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]] and older sibling [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]]. She is in a secret romantic relationship with [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]] that has become entangled with the murder investigation.

## Key Characteristics

- **Youngest Tallbloom** - The younger sibling in the family, protected by both [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] and indirectly by their mother [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]]
- **Secret romantic relationship** - Dating [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]], though they must hide their relationship due to family acceptance concerns
- **Protected by family** - Her siblings and romantic partner work to shield her from both family conflict and investigation complications
- **Key alibi provider** - Her relationship with [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]] provides mutual alibis for the night of [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder

## Role in the Investigation

**Crucial Alibi:** Syndra was with [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]] the night of [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder, providing both of them with alibis. This information was initially concealed by [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] to protect the family secret but was later revealed when [[Gralstak]] applied pressure.

**Family Secret Centre:** Her relationship with [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]] is the family secret that [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] was trying to protect when initially lying to investigators, showing how personal relationships complicate the murder investigation.

**Timeline Confirmation:** Her presence with [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]] during the night in question helps establish timelines and eliminates both young women from suspicion in the murder.

## Family Dynamics

**Protected by [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]]:** Her older sibling went to significant lengths to protect both Syndra's relationship secret and shield her from investigation scrutiny, even lying to investigators initially.

**Hidden from [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]]:** The relationship must be kept secret because their mother is described as heteronormative and unaccepting, creating ongoing family tension and stress.

**Family Unity:** Despite the secrecy around her relationship, the family shows strong protective instincts, with [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] quickly alerting [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]] when danger threatened at the blacksmith's.

## Romantic Relationship

**Secret Romance with [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]]:** Their relationship represents one of the hidden social dynamics in [[Cerbereburn|Cerbereburn]] that complicate the investigation. The need for secrecy creates additional layers of protection and concealment that investigators must navigate.

## Current Status

Syndra remains largely in the background of the investigation, protected by family members and her romantic partner. Her alibis continue to check out, and she appears to be an innocent party whose main significance lies in the complications her secret relationship creates for gathering accurate testimony from family members. The ongoing need to protect her from family discovery continues to influence how the Tallbloom family interacts with investigators.
