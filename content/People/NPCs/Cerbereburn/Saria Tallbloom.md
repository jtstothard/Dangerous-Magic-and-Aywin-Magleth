**Saria Tallbloom** is a resident of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] who runs the local stables and lives at the Tallbloom Home with her children [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] and [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]]. She has become involved in the investigation through environmental disputes and family connections to key witnesses.

## Key Characteristics

- **Stable owner and operator** - Runs the horse stables in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]], making her an important business owner in the community
- **Environmental victim** - Her stables suffer from pollution caused by [[Greyson Tools|Bertrum's forge]] upstream
- **Heteronormative and unaccepting** - According to [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]], she has conservative views that would make her disapprove of [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]]'s relationship with [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]]
- **Protective mother** - Quickly responded when [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] warned her about the confrontation at the blacksmith's

## Environmental Disputes

**River Pollution Conflict:** The pollution from [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]]'s blacksmithing operations directly affects Saria's stables downstream. The contaminated water harms her horses, creating ongoing tension between her and the blacksmith that adds another layer to the town's political conflicts.

**Business Impact:** The environmental damage to her livelihood gives her a concrete grievance against [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]], potentially providing motive if she were involved in any broader conspiracy against those she sees as harming the community.

## Family Dynamics

**Conservative Mother:** Her heteronormative views create family tension, as her daughter [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]] is in a relationship with [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]]. [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] works to protect both her younger sister and their mother from this difficult truth.

**Protective Instincts:** When [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] witnessed [[Gralstak]] carrying off [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] from the blacksmith's, she quickly warned Saria, showing the family's strong communication and mutual protection instincts.

## Role in Political Tensions

**Conflict with [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]:** According to [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]], [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] didn't get along with several townspeople, including Saria. This suggests ongoing friction between the lawmaster and the stable owner, likely related to either the environmental disputes or other political matters.

**Anti-Bertrum Stance:** Her conflict with [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]] over the river pollution aligns her with others in town who have grievances against various disruptive elements.

## Current Status

Saria remains focused on protecting her family and business while navigating the complex political and environmental challenges facing [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]]. Her role as both a business owner affected by environmental damage and a mother trying to maintain family stability makes her a key figure in understanding the town's social dynamics, even if she's not directly involved in the murder investigation.
