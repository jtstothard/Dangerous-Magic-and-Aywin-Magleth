**Saria Tallbloom** is a resident of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] who runs the local stables and lives at the Tallbloom Home with her children [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] and [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]]. She has become involved in the investigation through environmental disputes and family connections to key witnesses.

## Key Characteristics

- **Stable owner and operator** - Runs the horse stables in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]], making her an important business owner in the community
- **Environmental victim** - Her stables suffer from pollution caused by [[Greyson Tools|Bertrum's forge]] upstream
- **Heteronormative and unaccepting** - According to [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]], she has conservative views that would make her disapprove of [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]]'s relationship with [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]]
- **Protective mother** - Quickly responded when [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] warned her about the confrontation at the blacksmith's
- **More intelligent than she appears** - According to [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s surveillance files, requires careful watching due to her hidden intelligence
- **Unusually forthright** - Displays surprising honesty and directness when questioned, even about potentially incriminating topics

## Environmental Disputes

**River Pollution Conflict:** The pollution from [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]]'s blacksmithing operations directly affects Saria's stables downstream. The contaminated water harms her horses, creating ongoing tension between her and the blacksmith that adds another layer to the town's political conflicts.

**Business Impact:** The environmental damage to her livelihood gives her a concrete grievance against [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]], potentially providing motive if she were involved in any broader conspiracy against those she sees as harming the community.

## Family Dynamics

**Conservative Mother:** Her heteronormative views create family tension, as her daughter [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]] is in a relationship with [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]]. [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] works to protect both her younger sister and their mother from this difficult truth.

**Protective Instincts:** When [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] witnessed [[Gralstak]] carrying off [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] from the blacksmith's, she quickly warned Saria, showing the family's strong communication and mutual protection instincts.

## Role in Political Tensions

**Conflict with [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]:** According to [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]], [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] didn't get along with several townspeople, including Saria. This suggests ongoing friction between the lawmaster and the stable owner, likely related to either the environmental disputes or other political matters.

**Anti-Bertrum Stance:** Her conflict with [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]] over the river pollution aligns her with others in town who have grievances against various disruptive elements.

## Intelligence and Behavior Assessment

**[[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s Surveillance:** The lawmaster's files specifically noted that Saria is "more intelligent than she lets on" and should be kept under careful watch. This suggests Saria deliberately downplays her capabilities and insights.

**Interview with [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]]:**

- **Strategic Thinking:** When asked about werewolves and murders, gave a remarkably candid response about how she would use werechickens as a distraction if she were the murderer
- **Alibi Acknowledgment:** Freely admitted she was in bed during [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]]'s public announcement and acknowledged how useless that information was as an alibi
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Seemed to be sizing up [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] during their conversation, suggesting she was conducting her own assessment
- **Unusual Honesty:** Her overly forthright manner of discussing potentially incriminating topics was noted as oddly suspicious

**[[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] Suspicions:** Suggested that [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] might have motives regarding the chicken incidents, showing awareness of broader political dynamics

## Current Status

Saria remains focused on protecting her family and business while navigating the complex political and environmental challenges facing [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]]. However, her conversation with [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] revealed a much more complex and potentially calculating individual than previously understood.

Her combination of hidden intelligence (as noted by [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]), strategic thinking about criminal methods, and unusual candor when discussing potentially incriminating topics suggests she may be playing a deeper game than initially apparent. Whether this makes her a valuable ally who understands the town's dangers or a potential suspect who is clever enough to hide her involvement remains to be determined.

The fact that she was specifically flagged by the highly competent [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] as someone requiring careful watching elevates her from a simple business owner with family concerns to someone who may have significant influence on the town's affairs, for better or worse.
