**Mallone Ulaxidor** was the lawmaster of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]], a middle aged half elf who maintained order in the increasingly troubled town until her murder sparked the investigation that uncovered both political conspiracies and supernatural threats.

## Key Characteristics

- **Dedicated lawmaster** - Actively investigated local disputes and political tensions, keeping detailed notes about town conflicts
- **Middle aged half elf** - Described as wearing leather armour and carrying the authority of her office
- **Social figure** - Someone you could "have a drink with" according to [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]], suggesting she was approachable despite her official role
- **Conflict mediator** - Dealt with various disputes between townspeople, though not always successfully

## Role as Lawmaster

**Investigation and Documentation:** Mallone kept detailed surveillance files documenting not only official conflicts but also comprehensive intelligence on townspeople, including:

- The pollution feud between [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]] (blacksmith) and [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]] (stables)
- Keggronite land acquisitions, particularly by [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]]
- [[Narchis Cloudbrow|Narchis]]'s suspicions of the Keggronites
- Her personal dislike of [[Dhunta Rannacit|Dhunta]] as a "general complainer"
- Extensive surveillance of all newcomers, particularly those at [[Brightroot Apartments]]

**Intelligence Gathering Methods:** Her files reveal sophisticated surveillance operations:

- Regular drinking sessions with townspeople to "loosen their lips with liquor"
- Detailed behavioural assessments of potential troublemakers
- Ongoing monitoring of family dynamics and personal relationships
- Strategic separation of suspects during questioning (planned to separate [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] and [[Jafrak Keggranite|Jafrak]] for interrogation)

**Law Enforcement:** Her final public act was escorting the drunk tiefling [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]] out of [[The Owlbear Cub Tavern]] the night before her murder

## Political Tensions

**Multiple Enemies:** According to [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]], who used to drink with her, Mallone "had lots of enemies in town" and "didn't get on with" several key figures:

- The Keggronites ([[Jafrak Keggranite|Jafrak]] and [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]])
- [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]] the blacksmith
- [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]] who ran the stables
- [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]], who wanted his son [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] to take over as lawmaster

**Blamed for Escalation:** [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] specifically blamed Mallone for "escalating conflict" and praised the Keggronites, claiming things had been peaceful since her death.

## Surveillance Operations

**Comprehensive Intelligence Network:** Mallone's files reveal the extent of her surveillance operations throughout [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]]:

**Newcomer Monitoring:**

- **[[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]]:** Noted behavioral changes - more fidgety and skittish since returning, acquired "dexterity skills" in [[Aeremore]]
- **[[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]]:** Assessed as lacking self-control, likely to cause trouble
- **[[Ramman Onyxguard|Ramman]]:** Documented as authoritative but short-tempered, tracked his increasing frustration with [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]]
- **[[Snadwe Wemdiem|Snadwe]]:** Identified as nervous, skittish, and very easily peer-pressured

**Family Intelligence Gathering:**

- **Cloudbrow Family:** Discovered [[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]] knows about [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]]'s sneaking but has wrong idea about who she's seeing; documented family tensions over chicken vs. sheep profitability
- **Tallbloom Family:** Identified [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] as the only person she trusted in town ("chill and normal"), noted [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]]'s immaturity, and flagged [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]] as "more intelligent than she lets on"

**Key Figure Assessments:**

- **[[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]]:** Identified as most capable fighter, primary backup for violent situations
- **[[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]]:** Noted as most intelligent person in town, only reveals what she wants known, planned to interrogate separately from [[Jafrak Keggranite|Jafrak]]
- **Anti-Keggronite Stance:** Actively opposed Keggronite dominance of the town

**Intelligence Methods:** Used social drinking sessions to gather information, particularly targeting [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]], [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]], and [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] to extract intelligence about family dynamics and town relationships.

## The Murder

**Crime Scene:** Found dead in the street with a stab wound and no blood spatter, indicating she was killed elsewhere and moved. There were no signs of struggle and no evidence she returned home after leaving the tavern.

**Timeline:** Murdered sometime after escorting [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]] from the tavern, discovered the next morning by [[Tango Fowler|Tango]].

**Investigation Impact:** Her death immediately threw the town into chaos, with her nervous deputy [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] suddenly thrust into leadership during a crisis he was unprepared to handle.

## Personal Relationships

**Social Connections:** Despite her many political enemies, Mallone maintained drinking relationships with people like [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]] and was generally regarded as approachable and likeable on a personal level.

**Professional Isolation:** Her thorough investigation of town conflicts and her detailed documentation of problems made her many enemies among those involved in the various disputes she was trying to resolve.

## Legacy and Impact

**Intelligence Files as Evidence:** Her detailed surveillance files became crucial evidence for understanding not only the political landscape but also the complex social dynamics of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]]. The files revealed her sophisticated intelligence gathering methods and comprehensive knowledge of townspeople's secrets, motivations, and relationships.

**Professional Competence:** The depth and accuracy of her surveillance files demonstrate that Mallone was far more than just a local lawmaster - she operated an intelligence network that rivaled professional spy operations, suggesting she may have had training or experience beyond typical law enforcement.

**Power Vacuum:** Her death created an immediate leadership crisis that various parties attempted to exploit, with [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] pushing for his son's permanent appointment and [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] apparently gaining influence over the investigation.

**Loss of Institutional Knowledge:** With Mallone's death, the town lost not only its lawmaster but also its primary intelligence asset. Her successor [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] lacks both her investigative skills and her comprehensive knowledge of town dynamics.

**Catalyst for Crisis:** Her murder not only sparked the investigation but also seemed to trigger or coincide with the supernatural crisis that followed, suggesting her death may have been connected to larger forces threatening [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]]. The timing raises questions about whether she was eliminated because she was close to uncovering something significant.
