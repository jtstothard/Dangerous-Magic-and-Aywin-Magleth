**Mallone Ulaxidor** was the lawmaster of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]], a middle-aged half-elf who maintained order in the increasingly troubled town until her murder sparked the investigation that uncovered both political conspiracies and supernatural threats.

# Key Characteristics

- **Dedicated lawmaster** - Actively investigated local disputes and political tensions, keeping detailed notes about town conflicts
- **Middle-aged half-elf** - Described as wearing leather armour and carrying the authority of her office
- **Social figure** - Someone you could "have a drink with" according to [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]], suggesting she was approachable despite her official role
- **Conflict mediator** - Dealt with various disputes between townspeople, though not always successfully

# Role as Lawmaster

**Investigation and Documentation:** Mallone kept a detailed journal documenting the various conflicts and tensions in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]], including:
- The pollution feud between [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]] (blacksmith) and [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]] (stables)
- Keggronite land acquisitions, particularly by [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]]
- [[Narchis Cloudbrow|Narchis]]'s suspicions of the Keggronites
- Her personal dislike of [[Dhunta Rannacit|Dhunta]] as a "general complainer"

**Law Enforcement:** Her final public act was escorting the drunk tiefling [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]] out of The Owlbear Cub tavern the night before her murder, demonstrating her hands-on approach to maintaining order.

# Political Tensions

**Multiple Enemies:** According to [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]], who used to drink with her, Mallone "had lots of enemies in town" and "didn't get on with" several key figures:
- The Keggronites ([[Jafrak Keggranite|Jafrak]] and [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]])
- [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]] the blacksmith
- [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]] who ran the stables
- [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]], who wanted his son [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] to take over as lawmaster

**Blamed for Escalation:** [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] specifically blamed Mallone for "escalating conflict" and praised the Keggronites, claiming things had been peaceful since her death.

# The Murder

**Crime Scene:** Found dead in the street with a stab wound and no blood spatter, indicating she was killed elsewhere and moved. There were no signs of struggle and no evidence she returned home after leaving the tavern.

**Timeline:** Murdered sometime after escorting [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]] from the tavern, discovered the next morning by [[Tango Fowler|Tango]].

**Investigation Impact:** Her death immediately threw the town into chaos, with her nervous deputy [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] suddenly thrust into leadership during a crisis he was unprepared to handle.

# Personal Relationships

**Social Connections:** Despite her many political enemies, Mallone maintained drinking relationships with people like [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]] and was generally regarded as approachable and likeable on a personal level.

**Professional Isolation:** Her thorough investigation of town conflicts and her detailed documentation of problems made her many enemies among those involved in the various disputes she was trying to resolve.

# Legacy and Impact

**Journal as Evidence:** Her detailed notes became crucial evidence for understanding the political landscape that led to her murder, revealing the complex web of conflicts she was trying to manage.

**Power Vacuum:** Her death created an immediate leadership crisis that various parties attempted to exploit, with [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] pushing for his son's permanent appointment and [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] apparently gaining influence over the investigation.

**Catalyst for Crisis:** Her murder not only sparked the investigation but also seemed to trigger or coincide with the supernatural crisis that followed, suggesting her death may have been connected to larger forces threatening [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]].
