**Strondabella Keggranite** is part of the wealthy dwarven Keggranite family in [[Cerbereburn|Cerbereburn]], she is [[Jafrak Keggranite|Jafrak]]'s partner in both business and personal matters. She has emerged as a particularly significant figure in both the murder investigation and the supernatural crisis that followed.

## Key Characteristics

- **Wealthy businesswoman** - Co owner of extensive land holdings and business interests around [[Cerbereburn|Cerbereburn]]
- **Horse operation manager** - Owns horses that are hired out to villagers, giving her connections throughout the community
- **Watchful and wary** - Described as watching carefully and seeming wary during initial questioning
- **Potentially authoritative** - Worked with [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] to arrest party members, suggesting either official authority or significant influence

## Role in Town Politics

**Land Acquisition Empire:** Along with [[Jafrak Keggranite|Jafrak]], Strondabella has been systematically acquiring land in [[Cerbereburn|Cerbereburn]], creating widespread resentment among longtime residents. [[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]] particularly dislikes her and believes she would "pay someone else to commit murder" rather than do it herself.

**Economic Influence:** Her horse rental business creates economic connections throughout the town, potentially giving her leverage over various residents and insight into their activities.

**Political Tensions:** The friction between the Keggranites and [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] suggests ongoing disputes about their business practices, land acquisitions, or other political matters that could provide motive for murder.

## Role in the Investigation

**Primary Suspect:** Her wealth, political tensions with the victim, and the widespread belief that she could afford to hire an assassin made her an immediate suspect. [[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]]'s specific suspicion that she would pay others to commit murder suggests this theory has local support.

**Reluctant Cooperation:** When the party visited during the werewolf crisis, she "begrudgingly let them in," showing resistance to investigation but ultimately complying under pressure.

**Authority Figure:** Her collaboration with [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] in arresting [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] and [[Manmosu]] suggests she either has official authority in the town or has acquired enough influence to act in a law enforcement capacity.

## Current Status

Strondabella remains a key figure in both investigations. Her role in the arrests raises questions about whether she's obstructing justice, attempting to control the investigation, or simply panicking about the supernatural crisis. The party's suspicion that [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]] might have connections to her suggests she may be the link between the various mysterious elements of the case.

Her combination of wealth, political influence, and willingness to take authoritative action makes her one of the most potentially dangerous figures in [[Cerbereburn|Cerbereburn]], whether as a criminal mastermind or as someone whose attempts to help are actually making the situation worse.
