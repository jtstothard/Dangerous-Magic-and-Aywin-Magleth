**Danlas Ligroves** is a resident of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] and the father of deputy lawmaster [[Marius Ligroves]]. He lives in the Ligroves Home with his son and appears to be actively involved in local politics, particularly around the succession of leadership following [[Mallone Ulaxidor]]'s murder.

# Key Characteristics

- **Politically ambitious** - Actively pushing for his son [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] to become the new lawmaster
- **Pro-Keggronite sympathizer** - Praised the Keggronites and blamed [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] for escalating conflicts in town
- **Suspicious and watchful** - Became suspicious when [[Manmosu]] tried to distract him with magic during the party's investigation
- **Confident and calculating** - Seemed certain that [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] would soon become lawmaster, suggesting advance planning

# Political Stance

**Anti-Mallone sentiment:** According to [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]], [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] didn't get along with several townspeople, including [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]]. This friction was likely connected to their opposing views on how the town should be managed.

**Keggronite alliance:** Unlike many other townspeople who view the Keggronites with suspicion, [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] has praised them and believes things have been more peaceful since their increased influence. This puts him at odds with residents like [[Narchis Cloudbrow]] who fear Keggronite expansion.

**Succession planning:** [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] wants [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] to take over as lawmaster and seemed confident this would happen even before the murder investigation concluded.

# Role in the Investigation

**Questioned by investigators:** [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]] and [[Manmosu]] visited [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] under the pretense of reporting back to [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]]. During this conversation, he revealed his political stance and confidence about his son's future role.

**Household search:** While [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] was being questioned, [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] and [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] searched the Ligroves home. They found:
- [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]]'s diary with mostly mundane complaints about being overlooked
- Letters in [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]]'s room that were bureaucratic in nature, including rental and expansion discussions from the Keggronites

**Suspicious behavior:** When [[Manmosu]] attempted to use magic to distract him, [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] became suspicious, though [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]] helped defuse the situation by assisting with a fallen loom.

# Current Status

[[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] continues to live in the Ligroves Home with his son, who has now assumed temporary control as deputy lawmaster following [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s death. His political maneuvering and pro-Keggronite stance make him a person of interest in understanding the broader political motivations that may have led to the murder.
