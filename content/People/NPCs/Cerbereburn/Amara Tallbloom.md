**Amara Tallbloom** is a young adult and child of [[Saria Tallbloom]], who runs the stables in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]]. Amara lives at the Tallbloom Home with their mother and younger sister [[Syndra Tallbloom]].

## Key Characteristics

- **Protective of family secrets** - Initially lied to investigators about not hearing anything the night of [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder
- **Caught between loyalty and truth** - When intimidated by [[Gralstak]], eventually revealed that [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]] was visiting [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]] the night of the murder
- **Concerned about family acceptance** - Doesn't want [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]] to know about [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]]'s relationship with [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]] due to their mother being heteronormative and unaccepting suggesting previous conflict based on their gender
- **Observant and alert** - Witnessed the chaos at the blacksmith's when [[Gralstak]] carried off [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] and quickly warned their mother

## Role in the Investigation

Amara has been a reluctant but ultimately helpful witness in the murder investigation. They initially attempted to protect their family by withholding information, but their testimony about [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]]'s visit proved to be a crucial piece of the puzzle. Their quick thinking to alert their mother during the confrontation at the blacksmith's shows they remain vigilant about protecting their family's interests.
