**Shayee Cloudbrow** is a young resident of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] and daughter of [[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]]. She is in a secret romantic relationship with [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]] and has been a crucial witness in providing alibis and information about the town's political tensions.

## Key Characteristics

- **Young adult in secret relationship** - Dating [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]], though they must keep their relationship hidden due to [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]]'s heteronormative views
- **Knowledgeable about town politics** - Provided key information about [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s conflicts with various townspeople
- **Former drinking companion** - Used to drink with [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]], giving her insight into her perspective on town affairs

## Role in the Investigation

**Alibis and Witness:** Shayee has been involved in providing alibis, particularly for the night of [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder when she was visiting [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]]. This alibi was initially concealed by [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] to protect the family secret but was later revealed under pressure.

**Political Information Source:** Through her former drinking relationship with [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]], she was able to provide valuable insight into the lawmaster's conflicts with various townspeople, including the Keggranites, [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]], [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]], and [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]].

**Timeline Witness:** Her presence at the Tallbloom Home the night of the murder provides crucial timeline information, and her relationship with the victim gives her testimony additional weight.

## Romantic Relationship

**Secret Romance with [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]]:** Their relationship must be kept hidden because [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]] is described as heteronormative and unaccepting. This secrecy creates family stress and complicates their involvement in the investigation.

**Family Protection:** [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] initially lied to protect both the relationship secret and to avoid involving Shayee in the murder investigation, showing the lengths the family goes to protect each other.

## Family Dynamics

**Daughter of [[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]]:** Her mother's protective questioning about whereabouts suggests [[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]] may be aware of the relationship and concerned about its implications for the family during the investigation.

## Current Status

Shayee's alibis continue to line up with [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]]'s, and her information about town politics has proven valuable to the investigation. Her position as someone with insider knowledge of both the victim's perspectives and the town's hidden relationships makes her a continuing person of interest for gathering information rather than as a suspect.
