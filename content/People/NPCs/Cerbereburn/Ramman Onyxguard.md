**Ramman Onyxguard** is a newcomer resident of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] who lives in the [[Brightroot Apartments]]. His authoritative demeanor and escalating conflict with fellow resident [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]] have made him a person of interest in [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s surveillance files.

## Key Characteristics

- **Authoritative personality** - Described as having a naturally commanding presence and leadership tendencies
- **Short-tempered** - Prone to frustration and anger, particularly regarding other residents' behaviour

## Surveillance Intelligence

**[[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s Assessment:** The lawmaster's files, reveal that Ramman has been under careful observation since his arrival. His combination of authority and temper made him a person of interest for potential trouble.

**Relationship Deterioration:** Initial surveillance notes documented his authoritative nature and short temper. Later entries, written on a different day (noted by different ink), specifically tracked his increasing frustration with [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]], suggesting the conflict has been escalating over time.

## Role in the Investigation

**Person of Interest:** While not directly implicated in the murders, Ramman's temperament and conflicts make him someone worth monitoring. His authoritative nature combined with his short fuse could potentially lead to violent confrontations.

**Brightroot Apartments Connection:** As a resident of the same building where [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]] was murdered, and given the tensions between residents, Ramman represents part of the complex dynamics within the newcomer community that [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] was actively tracking.

## Current Status

Ramman remains under surveillance due to his potential for causing trouble, particularly regarding his ongoing conflict with [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]]. His authoritative personality and short temper make him someone the investigators should be aware of, even if he's not a primary suspect in the current murder investigation.
