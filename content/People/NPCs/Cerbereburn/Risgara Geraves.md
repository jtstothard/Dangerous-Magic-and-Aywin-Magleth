**Risgara Geraves** is a tiefling resident of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] who lives in the [[Brightroot Apartments]]. He was initially a prime suspect in [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder due to an incident the night before, but has since been largely dismissed as a red herring in the investigation.

## Key Characteristics

- **Tiefling resident** - One of the few tieflings in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]], making him stand out in the community
- **Heavy drinker** - Known for drinking heavily and becoming disruptive at the local tavern
- **Hungover and unhelpful** - When questioned by investigators, was suffering from a hangover and provided little useful information
- **Apartment dweller** - Lives in the [[Brightroot Apartments]], the same complex where [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]] was later murdered

## The Night Before the Murder

**Tavern Incident:** The night before [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder, Risgara was drunk and disruptive enough at the tavern that the lawmaster herself had to escort him out. This incident immediately made him a suspect when the murder was discovered.

**Prime Suspect Status:** His confrontation with the victim mere hours before her death created strong circumstantial evidence against him, and several townspeople, including [[Jafrak Keggranite|Jafrak]], initially suspected her of the crime.

## Role in the Investigation

**Red Herring:** Despite the promising initial evidence, Risgara's investigation proved disappointing. His hungover state and lack of useful information suggested he was too intoxicated the night of the murder to have been capable of the calculated killing.

**Mysterious Absence:** During the later supernatural crisis, when [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]]'s door was checked, it was locked and he wasn't present. [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]] had to *Eldritch Blast* the door open, but found no one inside, adding another layer of mystery to his whereabouts.

**Missing During Crisis:** He wasn't seen during the werewolf roll call when the party was checking townspeople for their safety, and her apartment was empty during a critical time, raising questions about where she went and whether she's safe.

## Current Status

Risgara appears to be a largely innocent bystander whose drunken behaviour created false leads in the murder investigation. However, his mysterious absence during the supernatural crisis raises new concerns, he may be another victim, hiding somewhere, or potentially connected to events in ways not yet understood.

## Living Situation

**[[Brightroot Apartments]]:** His residence in the same apartment complex where [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]] was murdered places him geographically close to the supernatural violence, though whether this makes him a potential victim or witness remains unclear.
