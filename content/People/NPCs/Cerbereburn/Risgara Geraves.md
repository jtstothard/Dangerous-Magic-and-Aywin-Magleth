**Risgara Geraves** is a tiefling resident of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] who lives in the Brighrood Apartments. She was initially a prime suspect in [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder due to an incident the night before, but has since been largely dismissed as a red herring in the investigation.

# Key Characteristics

- **Tiefling resident** - One of the few tieflings in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]], making her stand out in the community
- **Heavy drinker** - Known for drinking heavily and becoming disruptive at the local tavern
- **Hungover and unhelpful** - When questioned by investigators, was suffering from a hangover and provided little useful information
- **Apartment dweller** - Lives in the Brighrood Apartments, the same complex where [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]] was later murdered

# The Night Before the Murder

**Tavern Incident:** The night before [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder, Risgara was drunk and disruptive enough at the tavern that the lawmaster himself had to escort her out. This incident immediately made her a suspect when the murder was discovered.

**Prime Suspect Status:** Her confrontation with the victim mere hours before his death created strong circumstantial evidence against her, and several townspeople, including [[Jafrak Keggranite|Jafrak]], initially suspected her of the crime.

# Role in the Investigation

**Red Herring:** Despite the promising initial evidence, Risgara's investigation proved disappointing. Her hungover state and lack of useful information suggested she was too intoxicated the night of the murder to have been capable of the calculated killing.

**Mysterious Absence:** During the later supernatural crisis, when [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]]'s door was checked, it was locked and she wasn't present. [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]] had to *Eldritch Blast* the door open, but found no one inside, adding another layer of mystery to her whereabouts.

**Missing During Crisis:** She wasn't seen during the werewolf roll call when the party was checking townspeople for their safety, and her apartment was empty during a critical time, raising questions about where she went and whether she's safe.

# Current Status

Risgara appears to be a largely innocent bystander whose drunken behavior created false leads in the murder investigation. However, her mysterious absence during the supernatural crisis raises new concerns - she may be another victim, hiding somewhere, or potentially connected to events in ways not yet understood. Her status as a tiefling in a predominantly human community may also make her vulnerable to both supernatural threats and community suspicion.

# Living Situation

**Brighrood Apartments:** Her residence in the same apartment complex where [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]] was murdered places her geographically close to the supernatural violence, though whether this makes her a potential victim or witness remains unclear.
