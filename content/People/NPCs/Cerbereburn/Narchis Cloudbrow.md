**Narchis Cloudbrow** is a resident of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] who owns and operates a barn with his wife. He became involved in the investigation when his prized chicken [[Mrs Cluckerson]] went missing, which later proved to be connected to the supernatural crisis affecting the town.

# Key Characteristics

- **Devoted to his chickens** - Particularly attached to [[Mrs Cluckerson]], whom he believes "has gone to the city to make it big"
- **Security-conscious barn owner** - Only he and his wife have keys to the barn, making the lock-picking incident particularly concerning
- **Distraught and worried** - Visibly upset about [[Mrs Cluckerson]]'s disappearance and the break-in at his property
- **Anti-Keggronite sentiment** - Among the townspeople who suspect the Keggranites of being involved in the murder

# Role in the Investigation

**Crime Scene Provider:** The Cloudbrow barn became a secondary crime scene when it was discovered that the lock had been picked recently and [[Mrs Cluckerson]] had gone missing. This connected the chicken disappearance to the broader investigation.

**Key Witness:** His knowledge about who had access to the barn and his observations about the break-in provided crucial information about the scope of the criminal activity in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]].

**Political Alignment:** His suspicion of the Keggranites aligns him with other residents like [[Dhunta Rannacit|Dhunta]] who view the wealthy family's activities with distrust.

# Connection to Supernatural Crisis

**Patient Zero Location:** The barn appears to have been the epicenter of the werechicken outbreak, with [[Mrs Cluckerson]] likely being either the original victim or the primary spreader of the lycanthropic infection among the poultry.

**Surveillance Agreement:** He allowed [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] to keep watch overnight at the barn in case anything returned, showing willingness to cooperate with the investigation despite his distress.

# Family Situation

**Married Partnership:** Lives with his wife, and together they maintain strict control over barn access, suggesting a well-organized household that makes the break-in more significant.

**Cloudbrow Family:** Related to [[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]] and [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]], placing him within one of the established family networks in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]].

# Current Status

Narchis remains a concerned but cooperative resident whose property became an unexpected focal point of both investigations. His barn's role in the supernatural outbreak makes him an important witness to the timeline and spread of the lycanthropic infection, while his anti-Keggronite views place him among the political faction that opposes the wealthy family's influence in town.
