**Risgex Cloudbrow** is a silver dragonborn resident of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] and mother to [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]]. She has been a helpful but sometimes suspicious witness in the murder investigation and later assisted in discovering [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]]'s body.

## Key Characteristics

- **Silver dragonborn** - Notable for her draconic heritage in the largely non-dragonborn community
- **Protective mother** - Deeply concerned about her daughter [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]]'s whereabouts and activities
- **Anti-Keggronite sentiment** - Strongly dislikes [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] and suspects the wealthy family of criminal activity
- **Suspicious of magic** - Noticed [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]]'s *Minor Illusion* attempt and became suspicious of the party's magical activities

## Role in the Investigation

**Key Witness and Informant:** Risgex has been one of the more helpful residents in providing information about the town's political tensions. She was forthright about her dislike of [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] and her belief that the wealthy dwarf would "pay someone else to commit murder."

**Protective Questioning:** Was observed asking someone where they were the night of the murder, likely referring to her daughter [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]], showing her concern about family members being involved or implicated.

**Crime Scene Discovery:** Accompanied [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] and the party to discover [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]]'s mauled body in the forest, serving as an official witness to the second murder.

## Family Dynamics

**Mother to [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]]:** Her protective questioning about whereabouts the night of the murder suggests she may be aware of her daughter's relationship with [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]] and the potential complications this could create for the family.

**Cloudbrow Family Network:** Connected to [[Narchis Cloudbrow|Narchis]], placing her within one of the established family groups in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] that have been affected by the various crises.

## Interactions with the Party

**Initial Cooperation:** Greeted the party early in their investigation and was generally helpful in providing information about town dynamics and political tensions.

**Growing Suspicion:** Her observation of [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]]'s magical illusion attempt made her more wary of the party's methods, though she continued to cooperate with the investigation.

**Barn Access Denial:** When [[Gralstak]] and [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] poorly attempted to ask for a key to hide inside during their barn surveillance, she declined, showing reasonable caution about her property.

## Current Status

Risgex remains a valuable ally in the investigation despite her growing wariness of the party's magical activities. Her strong anti-Keggronite stance aligns her with the faction of townspeople who suspect the wealthy family, while her protective maternal instincts keep her focused on keeping her own family safe from the growing chaos in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]].
