**Bertrum Greyson** is the local blacksmith in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]], running his forge near the river. He operates Greyson Tools and is a central figure in several of the town's ongoing disputes and tensions.

# Key Characteristics

- **Grumpy and defensive** - Known for his unpleasant demeanor when questioned by investigators
- **Evasive and suspicious** - Couldn't identify the murder weapon when shown an illusion of it, and his behavior raises questions
- **Environmentally controversial** - His forge operations pollute the river, creating conflict with downstream businesses
- **Uncooperative** - Resistant to intimidation attempts and questioning from the party

# Role in Town Conflicts

**Environmental Disputes:** Bertrum's forge pollution is a major source of tension in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]]. The runoff from his blacksmithing operations affects the river, which directly impacts [[Saria Tallbloom]]'s stables downstream. The horses suffer from the polluted water, creating ongoing animosity between Bertrum and [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]].

**Political Tensions:** According to [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]], [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] didn't get along with several townspeople, including Bertrum. This suggests he was part of the broader political friction that [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] was trying to manage as lawmaster.

# Role in the Investigation

Bertrum remains a person of interest in [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder investigation:

- **Weapon expertise** - As a blacksmith, he would have knowledge of blades and could potentially have crafted the murder weapon
- **Failed identification** - When [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] used *Minor Illusion* to recreate the murder weapon, Bertrum claimed he couldn't identify it, though this could be deception
- **Unaccounted whereabouts** - His location during key events remains unclear, making him a continued suspect
- **Resistance to questioning** - [[Gralstak]]'s intimidation attempts failed, and Bertrum has been generally uncooperative with the investigation

## Current Status

Bertrum continues to operate his forge while remaining under suspicion. The party has surveilled his shop, with [[Gralstak]] camping outside during the night watch rotations. His evasive behavior and the ongoing environmental disputes keep him as a significant person of interest in the murder case.
