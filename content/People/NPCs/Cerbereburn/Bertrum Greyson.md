**Bertrum Greyson** is the local blacksmith in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]], operating his forge near the river. He runs [[Greyson Tools]] and is a central figure in several of the town's ongoing disputes and tensions.

## Key Characteristics

- **Grumpy and defensive** - Known for his unpleasant demeanour when questioned by investigators
- **Evasive and suspicious** - Couldn't identify the murder weapon when shown an illusion of it, and his behaviour raises questions
- **Environmentally controversial** - His forge operations pollute the river, creating conflict with downstream businesses
- **Uncooperative** - Resistant to intimidation attempts and questioning from the party

## Role in Town Conflicts

### Environmental Disputes

[[Greyson Tools|Bertrum's forge]] pollution is a major source of tension in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]]. The runoff from his blacksmithing operations affects the river, which directly impacts [[Saria Tallbloom]]'s stables downstream. The horses suffer from the polluted water, creating ongoing animosity between Bertrum and [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]].

### Political Tensions

According to [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]], [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] didn't get along with several townspeople, including Bertrum. This suggests he was part of the broader political friction that [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] was trying to manage as lawmaster.

## Intelligence Assessment

**[[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s Surveillance:** According to the lawmaster's confidential files, Bertrum was assessed as the "most capable fighter" in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] and identified as [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s "primary backup for violent situations." This reveals he was trusted for law enforcement support despite their personal conflicts.

## Professional Capabilities

**Lock and Key Creation:** Bertrum creates all the locks used in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]], working under [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s supervision to ensure only two keys exist per lock (one for the family, one for the lawmaster). This gives him unique knowledge of town security systems.

**Silver Work Discontinuation:** No longer crafts silver items due to "coastal wizards changing their mind" about lycanthrope resistances.

**Limited Social Network:** Claims to know everyone in town except the [[Brightroot Apartments]] residents, suggesting either deliberate avoidance or genuine disconnect from the newcomer community.

## Evidence Discovery

**Weapon Cache:** Party investigation revealed Bertrum possesses multiple daggers in his shop, including a specific dagger found hidden in his bedside table during the house search.

**Disturbing Artwork:** [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] discovered a crude drawing near the top of papers in his room depicting a tongue being cut by a blade with blood droplets. The placement and content suggest either threats, warnings, or psychological disturbance.

**Living Conditions:** His house shows very messy conditions with no expectation of visitors, consistent with someone either genuinely antisocial or deliberately maintaining isolation.

## Further Developments

**Interrogation Results:**

- **Alibi:** Claims to have been home alone during both murders
- **[[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]] Assessment:** Described them as a typical "dumb kid goes to city, gets knocked down, comes back with tail between legs," showing some fondness despite dismissive language
- **Defensive Reactions:** Became hostile when [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] expressed pity for his solitary lifestyle
- **Investigation Interference:** Ejected the entire party from his shop after [[Gralstak]]'s disruption and [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]]'s use of *Command* magic

**Tactical Implications:** If he were the murderer, [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s files suggest he would have targeted the [[Tallbloom Stables|Tallblooms]] directly rather than [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]], given his environmental disputes with [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]].

## Role in the Investigation

Bertrum remains a person of interest in [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder investigation:

- **Weapon expertise** - As a blacksmith, he would have knowledge of blades and could potentially have crafted the murder weapon
- **Failed identification** - When [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] used *Minor Illusion* to recreate the murder weapon, Bertrum claimed he couldn't identify it, though this could be deception
- **Unaccounted whereabouts** - His location during key events remains unclear, making him a continued suspect
- **Resistance to questioning** - [[Gralstak]]'s intimidation attempts failed, and Bertrum has been generally uncooperative with the investigation
- **Physical evidence** - The discovered dagger and disturbing artwork raise serious questions about his potential involvement

## Current Status

Bertrum continues to operate his forge while remaining under suspicion. The party has surveyed his shop, with [[Gralstak]] camping outside during the night watch rotations. The discovery of weapons and disturbing artwork in his house, combined with [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s assessment of his combat capabilities, has elevated him from a person of interest to a primary suspect.

His professional knowledge of town security systems, discontinuation of silver work during a lycanthrope crisis, and the physical evidence found in his home all contribute to mounting suspicion. However, his trusted relationship with [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] for law enforcement backup creates a complicated profile of someone who may be either a valuable ally turned enemy or an innocent craftsman caught in circumstantial evidence.
