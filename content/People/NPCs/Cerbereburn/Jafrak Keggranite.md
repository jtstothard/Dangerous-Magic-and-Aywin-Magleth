**Jafrak Keggranite** is one half of the wealthy dwarven Keggranite family in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]], along with his partner [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]]. The Keggranites have become central figures in the town's political tensions due to their land acquisition activities and are major suspects in [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder.

# Key Characteristics

- **Wealthy landowner** - Part of the Keggranite family that has been systematically buying up land in and around [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]]
- **Polite but evasive** - Described as polite during initial interactions but evasive when questioned about serious matters
- **Seemingly innocent** - When checked during the werewolf crisis, was found eating dinner and appeared genuinely innocent
- **Suspicious of outsiders** - Initially suspected the tiefling [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]] in [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder

# Role in Town Politics

**Land Acquisition Controversy:** The Keggranites' systematic purchase of land has created significant tension in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]]. Multiple townspeople, including [[Dhunta Rannacit|Dhunta]] and [[Narchis Cloudbrow|Narchis]], view their activities with deep suspicion and fear about the changing economic landscape of their community.

**Political Opposition:** According to [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]], [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] didn't get along with the Keggranites, suggesting ongoing friction between the lawmaster and the wealthy family. This tension makes them prime suspects in the murder investigation.

# Role in the Investigation

**Primary Suspects:** Both [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] and [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] visited the Keggranites early in the investigation. Jafrak's evasive behavior and the family's contentious relationship with the victim made them immediate persons of interest.

**Document Interest:** [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] expressed particular interest in accessing the Keggranites' documents, suggesting their business dealings might contain evidence relevant to the murder case.

**Werewolf Investigation:** During the supernatural crisis, when the party was checking townspeople, Jafrak was found eating dinner peacefully and seemed genuinely innocent of the lycanthrope threat, suggesting his potential guilt may be limited to more mundane criminal activities.

# Current Status

Jafrak remains a person of interest primarily due to the family's wealth, land disputes, and political tensions with the victim. However, his behavior during the werewolf investigation suggests he may not be involved in the supernatural elements of the case. The party's interest in accessing Keggranite documents indicates that any criminal involvement would likely be through more traditional means - financial manipulation, hiring others, or business-related motives rather than direct physical violence.
