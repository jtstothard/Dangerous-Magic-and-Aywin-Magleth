**Zymis Wenben** was a resident of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] who lived in the Brighrood Apartments. He became the second murder victim in the town's crisis, killed by what appears to be a werewolf attack in his own room.

# Key Characteristics

- **Apartment resident** - Lived in the Brighrood Apartments, making him a neighbor to several other suspicious individuals
- **Victim of supernatural violence** - Killed in what was confirmed to be a likely werewolf attack, with his body being mauled and torn apart
- **Struggled against attacker** - Evidence in his room showed clear signs of a struggle before his death

# The Murder

**Werewolf Attack:** Unlike [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder by blade, Zymis was killed by a lycanthrope. His body was found mauled and torn apart, confirming the supernatural threat that had been building in the town.

**Crime Scene Details:** His room showed signs of a struggle, with blood around the scene and an open window that likely served as the werewolf's entry or exit point. The violent nature of the attack contrasted sharply with the more calculated murder of the lawmaster.

**Discovery:** The party, along with [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] and [[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]], found his torn-up body in the forest, though the initial attack clearly occurred in his apartment room.

# Role in the Investigation

**Escalation Point:** Zymis's murder marked the escalation from a single murder investigation to a supernatural crisis, confirming that multiple threats were active in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] simultaneously.

**Blocked Investigation:** [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] blocked further investigation of Zymis's room, suggesting either official protocols or potential cover-up attempts that complicated the party's ability to gather evidence.

**Blood Trail Evidence:** His body was found with a nearby blood trail in the forest, suggesting either the werewolf dragged him there or he attempted to escape before succumbing to his injuries.

# Connection to Broader Crisis

**Supernatural Confirmation:** His death proved that the werechicken outbreak was connected to a larger lycanthropic presence in the town, linking the seemingly separate incidents of missing chickens and human murders.

**Timeline Implications:** The timing of his death, occurring during the party's investigation, suggests either coincidental werewolf activity or a calculated escalation by someone aware of the ongoing investigation.

# Current Status

Zymis's death serves as a crucial piece of evidence in understanding the supernatural threat level in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]]. His murder confirmed that the party was dealing with multiple types of threats - both human murderers and lycanthropic creatures - requiring different investigative approaches and safety precautions.
