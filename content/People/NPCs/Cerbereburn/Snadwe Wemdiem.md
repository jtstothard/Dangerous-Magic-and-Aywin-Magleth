**Snadwe Wemdiem** is a newcomer resident of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] who lives in the [[Brightroot Apartments]]. Her nervous disposition and susceptibility to peer pressure have made her a person of interest in [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s surveillance of the newcomer community.

## Key Characteristics

- **Nervous and skittish** - Displays anxious behavior and appears easily startled or worried
- **Highly suggestible** - Described as very easily peer-pressured, making her potentially manipulable
- **Newcomer status** - Recently arrived in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] along with other [[Brightroot Apartments]] residents
- **Vulnerable personality** - Her combination of nervousness and susceptibility makes her a potential target or unwitting accomplice

## Surveillance Intelligence

**[[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s Assessment:** The lawmaster's files, identify Snadwe as potentially problematic due to her psychological profile. Her nervous nature combined with her susceptibility to influence makes her someone who could easily be drawn into trouble by others.

**Peer Pressure Concerns:** [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s notes specifically highlight that Snadwe is "very easily peer-pressured," suggesting the lawmaster was concerned about her being manipulated by other residents or outside influences.

## Role in the Investigation

**Potential Accomplice:** While not necessarily a primary suspect, Snadwe's personality profile makes her someone who could be easily manipulated into assisting with criminal activities. Her nervous disposition and susceptibility to peer pressure could make her a useful tool for someone with malicious intent.

**Brightroot Apartments Connection:** As a resident of the same building where [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]] was murdered, and given her vulnerable personality, Snadwe represents someone who might have information or have been coerced into involvement without fully understanding the consequences.

**Intelligence Target:** Her suggestible nature makes her both a potential witness who might be intimidated into silence and someone who could be pressured into revealing information about other residents.

## Current Status

Snadwe remains under surveillance as part of the newcomer monitoring program. Her vulnerable psychological profile makes her someone the investigators should approach carefully, she could be either a valuable source of information or someone who has been manipulated into complicity. Her nervous nature suggests she might be more willing to cooperate if approached with the right combination of reassurance and authority.
