**Marius Ligroves** is a nervous gnome who served as deputy lawmaster under [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] and was suddenly thrust into the role of acting lawmaster following the murder. He lives at the Ligroves Home and is the son of [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]], who has political ambitions for his advancement.

## Key Characteristics

- **Nervous and inexperienced** - Described as nervous and overwhelmed by suddenly being in charge of a murder investigation
- **Reluctant authority figure** - Thrust into leadership during a crisis but lacks the confidence and experience to handle the situation effectively
- **Easily manipulated** - Susceptible to influence from figures like [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] and pressure from his father [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]]
- **Obstructive to investigation** - Blocked further investigation of [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]]'s room and made questionable decisions about arrests

## Role as Acting Lawmaster

**Sudden Promotion:** Following [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder, Marius was forced into the position of lawmaster despite being clearly unprepared for the responsibility. His nervousness and inexperience have made him an ineffective leader during the crisis.

**Questionable Decisions:** His collaboration with [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] to arrest [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] and [[Manmosu]] raised serious questions about his judgment and potential corruption or manipulation by powerful interests.

**Investigation Interference:** Blocked the party from conducting a thorough investigation of [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]]'s room after the werewolf attack

**Security Failures:** Despite being responsible for prisoner security, was easily manipulated by [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] during jail interactions and failed to notice his keys being stolen by her *Unseen Servant*. Later discovered both prisoners had escaped and didn't immediately notice [[Manmosu]]'s absence until it was pointed out to him.

## Family Influences

**Father's Ambitions:** [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] wants Marius to take over as lawmaster permanently, creating additional pressure on the already overwhelmed young gnome. This family ambition may influence his decision-making during the investigation.

**Political Positioning:** His father's political desires mean that Marius's actions as acting lawmaster are influenced not just by law enforcement needs but also by family expectations and political manoeuvring.

## Interactions with the Party

**Failed Arrest Attempt:** When he saw [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] casting spells, he attempted to arrest the party member but failed when [[Gralstak]] simply picked him up and walked away, demonstrating his lack of physical authority to back up his position.

**Witness to Discovery:** Accompanied the party and [[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]] to discover [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]]'s mauled body in the forest, serving as an official witness to the supernatural escalation.

**Further Developments:**

- **Jail Management:** Interacted with prisoners [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] and [[Manmosu]], was manipulated by [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]]'s compliments about the jail quality, threatened to make conditions worse but was not taken seriously
- **Theft Victim:** Had his master keys pickpocketed by [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]]'s *Unseen Servant* without noticing, leading to the prisoners' escape
- **Investigation of Magical Misconduct:** Responded to [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]]'s complaints about [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]]'s spellcasting, showed some incompetence in handling the magical misconduct case
- **Key Recovery Confusion:** Became bewildered during the key recovery situation, accused [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] of theft, then accused her of planting keys on [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]], showing poor investigative reasoning
- **Administrative Actions:** Issued official warnings to [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] and [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]], insisted they carry the warnings personally for repeat offence tracking

**Continued Involvement:** Despite his various failures and questionable decisions, he remains the acting lawmaster and continues to be involved in both the murder investigation and the supernatural crisis response.

## Current Status

Marius remains in the difficult position of trying to maintain order and investigate crimes that are clearly beyond his capabilities and experience level. His collaboration with [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] and his interference with the investigation continue to raise questions about whether he's simply incompetent, corrupt, or being manipulated by more powerful forces in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]].

Recent events have further highlighted his inadequacies as a lawmaster, being easily deceived during prisoner interactions, failing to secure his keys, and showing confused investigative reasoning during the key theft incident. However, his handling of the magical misconduct case showed some marginal competence, suggesting he might be capable of basic administrative duties even if major investigations are beyond him.

His nervous demeanour and poor decision-making have made him more of an obstacle than a help to resolving the crises facing the town, while his family's political ambitions add another layer of complication to his already overwhelming situation. The fact that he completely failed to notice [[Manmosu]]'s escape until it was pointed out demonstrates his fundamental unsuitability for the role, yet he continues to hold the position due to lack of alternatives and his father's political manoeuvring.
