## Basic Information

- **Species:** Gnome
- **Physical description:** Nervous, small, often overwhelmed, visibly anxious
- **Key relationships:** [[Danlas Ligroves]] (father), [[Mallone Ulaxidor]] (mentor, deceased), [[Strondabella Keggranite]] (influential), party members (frequent interactions)

## Character Overview

- **Class:** Civilian (Acting Lawmaster)
- **Personality traits:** Lacks confidence, easily manipulated, eager to please, indecisive, well-meaning but out of depth
- **Notable equipment/companions:** Lawmaster's keys (frequently misplaced), official warnings

## Background

- **Origins:** Native of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]], son of [[Danlas Ligroves]]
- **Goals:** Maintain order, live up to family expectations, survive the crisis
- **Connections to other characters:** Deputy to [[Mallone Ulaxidor]], pressured by [[Danlas Ligroves]], manipulated by [[Strondabella Keggranite]], frequent target of party's actions

## Recent Developments

- **[[Notes/Session 6|Session 6]]:** Subjected to intense (and demoralising) questioning by [[Gralstak]], who attempted to bribe and pressure him for information about the murders. With the death of [[Foxtrot Fowler]] and the werewolf's defeat, the murder investigation is now closed. Marius remains acting lawmaster, but his confidence and reputation have suffered further setbacks.

## Investigation Notes

- Easily manipulated by party and town notables
- Blocked further investigation of [[Zymis Wenben]]'s room after werewolf attack
- Failed to notice keys being stolen by [[Lyra Shadowflame]]'s *Unseen Servant*, leading to prisoner escape
- Issued official warnings to party members, insisted on personal tracking
- Responded to magical misconduct complaints, handled poorly
- Remains acting lawmaster, but is widely seen as unfit for the role
