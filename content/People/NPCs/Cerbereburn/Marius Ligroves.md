**Marius Ligroves** is a nervous gnome who served as deputy lawmaster under [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] and was suddenly thrust into the role of acting lawmaster following the murder. He lives at the Ligroves Home and is the son of [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]], who has political ambitions for his advancement.

## Key Characteristics

- **Nervous and inexperienced** - Described as nervous and overwhelmed by suddenly being in charge of a murder investigation
- **Reluctant authority figure** - Thrust into leadership during a crisis but lacks the confidence and experience to handle the situation effectively
- **Easily manipulated** - Susceptible to influence from figures like [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] and pressure from his father [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]]
- **Obstructive to investigation** - Blocked further investigation of [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]]'s room and made questionable decisions about arrests

## Role as Acting Lawmaster

**Sudden Promotion:** Following [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder, Marius was forced into the position of lawmaster despite being clearly unprepared for the responsibility. His nervousness and inexperience have made him an ineffective leader during the crisis.

**Questionable Decisions:** His collaboration with [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] to arrest [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] and [[Manmosu]] raised serious questions about his judgment and potential corruption or manipulation by powerful interests.

**Investigation Interference:** Blocked the party from conducting a thorough investigation of [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]]'s room after the werewolf attack

## Family Influences

**Father's Ambitions:** [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] wants Marius to take over as lawmaster permanently, creating additional pressure on the already overwhelmed young gnome. This family ambition may influence his decision-making during the investigation.

**Political Positioning:** His father's political desires mean that Marius's actions as acting lawmaster are influenced not just by law enforcement needs but also by family expectations and political manoeuvring.

## Interactions with the Party

**Failed Arrest Attempt:** When he saw [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] casting spells, he attempted to arrest the party member but failed when [[Gralstak]] simply picked him up and walked away, demonstrating his lack of physical authority to back up his position.

**Witness to Discovery:** Accompanied the party and [[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]] to discover [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]]'s mauled body in the forest, serving as an official witness to the supernatural escalation.

**Continued Involvement:** Despite his various failures and questionable decisions, he remains the acting lawmaster and continues to be involved in both the murder investigation and the supernatural crisis response.

## Current Status

Marius remains in the difficult position of trying to maintain order and investigate crimes that are clearly beyond his capabilities and experience level. His collaboration with [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] and his interference with the investigation continue to raise questions about whether he's simply incompetent, corrupt, or being manipulated by more powerful forces in [[Cerbereburn|Cerbereburn]].

His nervous demeanour and poor decision-making have made him more of an obstacle than a help to resolving the crises facing the town, while his family's political ambitions add another layer of complication to his already overwhelming situation.
