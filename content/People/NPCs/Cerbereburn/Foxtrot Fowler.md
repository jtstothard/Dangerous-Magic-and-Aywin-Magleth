**Foxtrot Fowler** is a resident of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] and partner to [[Tango Fowler]], who found [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s body. Foxtrot has recently returned to town after being away for years, making them a person of significant interest in the murder investigation.

# Key Characteristics

- **Recently returned** - Was gone for years and only returned to [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] a few months ago
- **Secretive and evasive** - Clearly hiding something important when questioned by investigators
- **Shocked by supernatural elements** - When charmed by [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]], was genuinely shocked by the idea of werechickens and alarmed that the party had killed any
- **Mysterious whereabouts** - Frequently absent when the party tries to locate them, with [[Tango Fowler|Tango]] not knowing their location

# Role in the Investigation

**Person of Interest:** Foxtrot's recent return to town coinciding with the murder has made them a key suspect. The combination of their mysterious absence from town for years, their secretive behavior, and their partner being the one to discover the body creates multiple layers of suspicion.

**Supernatural Connection:** When [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] used *Charm Person* to question them, Foxtrot's reaction to learning about werechickens was telling - they seemed genuinely shocked and concerned that the party had killed any, suggesting they may have knowledge about the supernatural elements plaguing the town.

**Evasive Behavior:** During the night surveillance, when [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] visited the Fowlers, [[Tango Fowler|Tango]] answered and didn't know where Foxtrot was, adding to the mystery of their movements and activities.

# Current Status

Foxtrot remains one of the primary suspects in the investigation. Their combination of recent arrival, secretive behavior, potential supernatural knowledge, and connection to the crime scene through their partner makes them a crucial figure to resolve. The party suspects they may have connections to either the forest incidents or possibly [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]], though the exact nature of what they're hiding remains unclear.

# Relationship Dynamics

**Partnership with [[Tango Fowler|Tango]]:** Despite being partners, there appears to be some disconnect between them, with Tango often not knowing Foxtrot's whereabouts. This could indicate either normal independence or something more concerning about their relationship dynamics in the context of the investigation.
