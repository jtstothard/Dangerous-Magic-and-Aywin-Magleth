**Foxtrot Fowler** is a resident of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] and partner to [[Tango Fowler]], who found [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s body. Foxtrot has recently returned to town after being away for years, making them a person of significant interest in the murder investigation.

## Key Characteristics

- **Recently returned** - Was gone for years and only returned to [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] a few months ago
- **Secretive and evasive** - Clearly hiding something important when questioned by investigators
- **Shocked by supernatural elements** - When charmed by [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]], was genuinely shocked by the idea of werechickens and alarmed that the party had killed any
- **Mysterious whereabouts** - Frequently absent when the party tries to locate them, with [[Tango Fowler|Tango]] not knowing their location
- **Behavioral changes** - More fidgety and skittish than before their departure, according to [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s surveillance
- **New skills acquired** - Picked up dexterity tricks while in [[Aeremore]], suggesting they learned new abilities during their absence

## Surveillance Intelligence

**[[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s Assessment:** The lawmaster's files, reveal ongoing surveillance of Foxtrot since their return. [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] noted significant behavioural changes - they are "more fidgety and skittish than before" and have "picked up some sort of dexterity skill in [[Aeremore]]."

**Skill Development Concerns:** The fact that Foxtrot gained "dexterity tricks" while away raises questions about what exactly they were doing in [[Aeremore]]. These could be anything from legitimate trade skills to more concerning abilities like lockpicking, sleight of hand, or combat training.

**[[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]]'s Opinion:** The blacksmith described Foxtrot as a typical case of "dumb kid goes to city, gets knocked down, comes back with tail between legs," though he seemed to have some fondness for them despite this assessment.

## Role in the Investigation

**Person of Interest:** Foxtrot's recent return to town coinciding with the murder has made them a key suspect. The combination of their mysterious absence from town for years, their secretive behaviour, and their partner being the one to discover the body creates multiple layers of suspicion.

**Supernatural Connection:** When [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] used *Charm Person* to question them, Foxtrot's reaction to learning about werechickens was telling - they seemed genuinely shocked and concerned that the party had killed any, suggesting they may have knowledge about the supernatural elements plaguing the town.

**Evasive Behaviour:** During the night surveillance, when [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] visited the Fowlers, [[Tango Fowler|Tango]] answered and didn't know where Foxtrot was, adding to the mystery of their movements and activities.

## Current Status

Foxtrot remains the primary suspect in the investigation. Their combination of recent arrival, secretive behaviour, potential supernatural knowledge, connection to the crime scene through their partner, and newly acquired dexterity skills makes them a crucial figure to resolve. The behavioral changes noted by [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] - increased fidgetiness and new skills - suggest their time in [[Aeremore]] significantly changed them, though whether for legitimate or criminal reasons remains unclear.

**Key Questions:** What exactly did Foxtrot do in [[Aeremore]]? What are these "dexterity tricks" they learned? Are their behavioral changes due to trauma, guilt, or involvement in criminal activities? Their reaction to the supernatural elements suggests they may know more about the lycanthrope situation than they're letting on.

## Relationship Dynamics

**Partnership with [[Tango Fowler|Tango]]:** Despite being partners, there appears to be some disconnect between them, with Tango often not knowing Foxtrot's whereabouts. This could indicate either normal independence or something more concerning about their relationship dynamics in the context of the investigation.
