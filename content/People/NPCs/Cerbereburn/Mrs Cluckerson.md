**Mrs Cluckerson** is [[Narchis Cloudbrow|Narchis]]'s prized chicken who went missing from the [[Cloudbrow Farm & Barn|Cloudbrow Barn]], believed to be the first victim of the werechicken crisis that would later plague [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]].

## Key Characteristics

- **Prized poultry** - Beloved by [[Narchis Cloudbrow|Narchis]], who believes she "went to the city to make it big"
- **Patient Zero** - Likely the first chicken to be infected with lycanthropy, starting the supernatural outbreak
- **Missing and dangerous** - Still unaccounted for and potentially feral or fully transformed

## Role in the Supernatural Crisis

**Werechicken Outbreak Origin:** Mrs Cluckerson's disappearance coincided with the barn break in and appears to be the starting point for the lycanthropic infection among the local poultry. Her infection likely spread to other chickens before she escaped or was taken.

**Evidence of Break In:** Her disappearance was connected to the discovery that the [[Cloudbrow Farm & Barn|Cloudbrow Barn]] lock had been picked recently, suggesting either she was taken by someone or something, or she escaped during a transformation.

**Continued Threat:** Unlike the other werechickens that were discovered and dealt with by the party, Mrs Cluckerson remains missing and potentially dangerous. As the apparent patient zero, she may be the most advanced or powerful of the infected birds.

## Investigation Significance

**Connection Point:** Her case links the mundane murder investigation to the supernatural elements, showing that multiple types of threats were active in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] simultaneously.

**Timeline Marker:** Her disappearance helps establish when the supernatural crisis began relative to [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder, providing crucial timeline information for understanding the sequence of events.

**Surveillance Target:** [[Narchis Cloudbrow|Narchis]] allowed [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] to keep watch overnight at the barn in case Mrs Cluckerson returned.

## Current Status

Mrs Cluckerson remains at large and potentially dangerous. Her status as the original infected chicken makes her a priority target for resolution of the supernatural crisis. Whether she can be saved, needs to be contained, or has become something more dangerous than a simple werechicken remains unknown.

## Symbolic Importance

**Town Innocence Lost:** Her transformation from beloved pet to supernatural threat symbolises how the crisis has corrupted even the most innocent aspects of life in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]].

**[[Narchis Cloudbrow|Narchis]]'s Hope:** Her owner's belief that she went to pursue stardom rather than accepting the supernatural explanation shows the psychological difficulty residents have in accepting the reality of their situation.
