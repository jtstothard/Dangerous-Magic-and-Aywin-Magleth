**Tango Fowler** is a resident of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] who discovered [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murdered body, making them the first witness in the investigation. They live with their partner [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]] in the Fowler Home.

## Key Characteristics

- **Discoverer of the crime** - Found [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s body, establishing them as the first person to encounter the murder scene
- **Helpful but limited witness** - Answered the door when investigators visited but had limited information to provide
- **Concerned partner** - Showed uncertainty about [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]]'s whereabouts when questioned, suggesting either normal concern or potential relationship tension

## Role in the Investigation

**Primary Witness:** As the person who discovered the body, Tango's testimony and observations about the crime scene would have been crucial to establishing the initial facts of the case. Their role as the discoverer makes them an important but likely uninvolved witness.

**Limited Information Source:** When [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] visited the Fowlers during night surveillance, Tango answered the door but couldn't provide information about [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]]'s location, indicating either a normal level of independence in their relationship or potential concerns about their partner's activities.

## Current Status

Tango appears to be a largely innocent witness whose main significance to the investigation stems from their discovery of the crime. Unlike their partner [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]], Tango has not exhibited suspicious behaviour or evasiveness that would make them a person of interest. Their role seems to be that of an unfortunate witness who happened upon the scene rather than someone with ulterior motives.

## Relationship with [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]]

The dynamic between Tango and [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]] appears somewhat strained or disconnected, with Tango frequently not knowing their partner's whereabouts. This could be normal relationship independence, but in the context of the investigation where [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]] is exhibiting suspicious behaviour, it adds another layer of concern about what might be happening within the Fowler household.
