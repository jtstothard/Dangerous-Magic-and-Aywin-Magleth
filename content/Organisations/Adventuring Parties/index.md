## Overview

The [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/index|Aeremore]] Adventurers' League is referenced in [[Notes/Session 7|Session 7]] and [[Notes/Session 8|Session 8]] as the organisation that contracted adventurers to target the party and recover missing plans. Their activities and influence are currently unclear, but they operate in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/index|Aeremore]] and [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/index|Jealeon]].

Parties looking for adventuring work in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/index|Aeremore]] will either sign up with the AAL or one of the magical institutes in the city.

As it's not explicitly a magical establishment, the AAL is generally easier to get a foothold in, though progression and making a name for yourself can be harder.

Once a job has been taken, it's gone, no competing to see who can complete it first.

The jobs board has ranks, what jobs you can take is dictated by your standing in the League.

Some jobs have symbols from various magical institutions in the Pentaturres. These jobs have no payment listed, instead, on completion, you can delve into some of the institution's secrets and findings.
