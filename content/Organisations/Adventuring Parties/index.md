## Overview

The [[Aeremore]] Adventurers' League is referenced in [[Notes/Session 7|Session 7]] as the organisation that contracted adventurers to target the party and recover missing plans. Their activities and influence are currently unclear, but they operate in Aeremore and Jealeon.

Parties looking for adventuring work in Aeremore will either sign up with the AAL or one of the magical institutes in the city.

As it's not explicitly a magical establishment, the AAL is generally easier to get a foothold in, though progression and making a name for yourself can be harder.
