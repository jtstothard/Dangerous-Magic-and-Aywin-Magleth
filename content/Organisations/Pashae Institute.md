## Recent Developments

- **[[Notes/Session 10|Session 10]]**:
  - The party infiltrated the Pashae Institute to locate Abel Milhaud.
  - Evidence of magical experiments was discovered, including enchanted kitchenware.
  - Abel Milhaud was rescued, though the purpose of the experiments remains unclear.
- **[[Notes/Session 11|Session 11]]**:
  - The party rescued Abel Milhaud, who was found pale and weak, with puncture marks indicating blood theft. The room contained vials of unknown substances, suggesting ongoing experiments.
  - The institute's mages engaged the party in combat, using potions that enhanced their speed and resilience but caused visible physical degradation. One mage escaped using invisibility, while the other was killed. Upon death, the mage's body exploded with arcane energy.
  - The party successfully escaped with Abel, but the institute's response to this intrusion remains uncertain.
- **[[Notes/Session 12|Session 12]]**:
  - [[Abel Milhaud]] recovered enough to provide an account of his ordeal: the institute had been forcing him into magical situations (illusions) where he had to cast spells to survive, then draining his blood afterward.
  - Blood analysis revealed that sorcerer blood functions as magical storage, with Abel's blood showing signs of decay from dark magic.
  - The party's break-in caused diplomatic tensions with the [[Organisations/Adventuring Parties/index|Adventurers' League]], as the institute is a benefactor organisation.
