## Overview

The Central Bureaucracy is the main administrative body of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cirrubi/index|Cirrubi|Cirrubi]], formerly the capital of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/index|Aswesh]].

## Recent Developments

- [[Notes/Session 12|Session 12]]: Architectural plans for [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/Buildings/Magleth Manor|Magleth Manor]] were reportedly stolen from the bureaucracy. The theft was allegedly committed by people matching [[The Prime Suspects]]' descriptions, though [[People/NPCs/Legendary/Aywin Magleth|Aywin Magleth]] claims no responsibility for either the theft or the use of their likenesses.
- [[Notes/Session 15|Session 15]]: The party, posing as crownsguard investigators, infiltrated the Central Bureaucracy with the help of a charmed guard. Lharamit discovered a magically doctored report about her family and an old soul-sucking case from Penketh. The archives contained a lingering foul smell, and Lyra triggered a magical glyph that summoned undead, causing chaos in the stacks. The incident revealed possible magical tampering and ongoing threats within the bureaucracy.
- [[Notes/Session 16|Session 16]]: The party fought a giant zombie and shadow creatures in the archives, discovered missing and inconsistent site plans with a wizard's sigil, and escaped under suspicion after [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]] lied to the guards. Increased guard scrutiny and missing archive items have made the bureaucracy a focus of city-wide investigation.
