## Journal Entry

The aftermath of our battle with [[People/NPCs/Cirrubi/Snadneg|Snadneg]] left the air thick with tension and curiosity. [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]]'s investigation of the gnome's body revealed a conjuration infused stone, so smooth it seemed unnatural, and so dangerous it nearly overwhelmed her mind. [[Thanatos]], ever the unpredictable companion, snatched it up, but it was [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]] who braved its psychic storm. I watched, ready to intervene, as she attuned to the artefact and slipped into a space that felt wrong even to witness. The entity she contacted, [[People/NPCs/Patrons/Vicky|Vicky]], spoke in whispers just behind her, offering power and a pact in exchange for opposition to necromancy. The implications unsettled me; I've never heard of a patron like Vicky, and her motives seem both logical and manipulative.

Our conversation with the mercenaries revealed their grim assignment: assassinate [[People/NPCs/Aeremore/Leana Olephena|Leana]] Olephena, director of the [[Organisations/Lorstan Olaphina Foundation for Arcane Learning|LOFFAL]] in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/index|Aeremore]]. The gnome, [[People/NPCs/Cirrubi/Snadneg|Snadneg]], was driven by personal vendetta and perhaps by [[People/NPCs/Patrons/Vicky|Vicky]]'s influence. [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]], ever the enigma, shared more of his past, his role in a lord's death, his disdain for the class system, and his penchant for revolution. The party's dynamic shifted as blood was exchanged (for alchemical curiosity, not ritual), and secrets spilled in the dim light of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cirrubi/Buildings/The Empty Apple Tavern|The Empty Apple Tavern]].

Our arrival in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cirrubi/index|Cirrubi]] was marked by playful moments, [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] and I commandeered [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]]'s room for a sleepover, painting nails and playing truth or dare, while [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]], [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]], and [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] kept watch over the rock. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]]'s quest for a feather from [[Hooty]] was a small but meaningful gesture. The night's rest did little to ease the underlying tensions, especially as [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]] debated [[People/NPCs/Patrons/Vicky|Vicky]]'s offer and shared her tragic family history. [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]] and I clashed over our homelands, [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Spuaburg|Spuaburg]] and [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Loshium|Loshium]], exposing old wounds and new misunderstandings. The party's unity felt fragile, but our shared burdens kept us moving forward.

Before entering [[Cirrubi]] proper, we disguised ourselves using a Seeming potion gifted to us by [[People/NPCs/Legendary/Aywin Magleth|Aywin Magleth]]. Each transformation reflected hidden desires and anxieties:

- [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]]: Became a half orc with long, flowing hair and a braided beard, more green than usual.
- [[People/Party/Lyra Shadowflame|I]]: Chose to look like [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]]'s half brother, human, less green, but still recognisably Gralstak.
- [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]]: Appeared younger and thinner, but still a loxodon.
- [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]]: Transformed into a brilliant blue aarakocra, plumage reminiscent of an Asian fairy bluebird.
- [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]]: Became a halfling with fluffy hair forming a mane around their neck.
- [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]]: Appeared as a silver dragonborn, unscarred, with both hands and eyes restored.

Something in Robin tried to resist the illusion. Whatever his baseline illusion is seems to serve to put people at ease; Lharamit and Manmosu noticed its absence. As we stepped into the city, I couldn't help but wonder what new conspiracies awaited us, and whether Vicky's whisper would echo through our choices yet to come.
