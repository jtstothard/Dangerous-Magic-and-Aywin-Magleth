## Journal Entry

The night we arrived in town, the air was heavy with the promise of rain, though none came. [[Gralstak]] and I had been travelling together for a few days by then, an unlikely pair, to be sure. He's gruff and imposing, with a penchant for brewing strange potions, while I'm… well, me. But there's something oddly reassuring about his presence, like having a storm at your back that you know won't strike you. We'd heard about [[The Owlbear Cub Tavern]] from a passing merchant and decided it would be a good place to rest before continuing to [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/index|Aeremore]].

The tavern was lively when we arrived, its warm glow spilling out into the dark street. Inside, the smell of ale and roasted meat mingled with the chatter of locals. It was a welcome change from the quiet of the road. As we settled in, I couldn't help but notice the others, a curious mix of travellers who seemed as out of place as we were. [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]], the bunny-like acolyte, was deep in conversation with [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]], a dragonborn with a glass eye that seemed to glint with secrets. [[Manmosu]], the Loxodon, was scribbling notes with a precision that suggested he missed nothing. And then there was [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]], whose polished appearance and easy charm made him stand out like a jewel in the rough.

The night passed uneventfully, though there was a moment of tension when [[Mallone Ulaxidor]], the town lawmaster, escorted a drunken tiefling out of the tavern. She had an air of authority about her, but there was something else, weariness, perhaps, or the weight of responsibility. I remember thinking she seemed like someone who carried the burdens of others, and I wondered what kind of town needed someone like her. I didn't have to wonder for long.

By morning, she was dead.

The sight of her body in the street was jarring. She lay there, lifeless, her rapier untouched by her side. There was no blood, no sign of a struggle, just the stillness of death. [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] was the first to approach, her faith compelling her to act, but the townsfolk were quick to cast suspicion on her. It was unfair, but fear makes people irrational. I could see the pain in her eyes as they whispered accusations.

The town was thrown into chaos, and we found ourselves at the centre of it. [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]], the nervous gnome deputy left in charge, initiated a lockdown and practically begged us to investigate. It wasn't a role I sought, but I couldn't ignore the injustice of it all. [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] deserved better than to be forgotten, and if no one else would seek the truth, then we would.

[[Gralstak]] and I decided to question [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]], the blacksmith. Using *Minor Illusion*, I recreated the murder weapon based on the wound we observed. It was a small triumph, though [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]] couldn't identify it. [[Gralstak]]'s attempts at intimidation were less successful, but I admired his determination. Meanwhile, the others pursued their own leads. [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] and [[Manmosu]] investigated [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s home, uncovering her journal filled with notes about local disputes. The Keggronites, a prominent family in town, seemed to be at the centre of much of the tension. Their land purchases and evasive behaviour raised more questions than answers.

By the end of the day, we had more questions than answers. The Keggronites' motives remained unclear, and [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]], the drunken tiefling, seemed more pitiable than guilty. Yet, the pieces didn't fit together. [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s death felt like the first move in a larger game, one we were only beginning to understand.

As I write this, I can't help but feel a sense of unease. The town is holding its breath, waiting for the next blow to fall. And I, for all my knowledge and magic, feel powerless to stop it. But I won't give up. [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] deserves justice, and I'll do everything in my power to uncover the truth, even if it means facing the darkness that lurks in the shadows of this town.
