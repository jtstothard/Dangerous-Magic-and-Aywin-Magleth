# **Investigation Highlights:**

## **Lharamit & Manmosu:**

- Investigated Mallone's house.
- Manmosu tried to break in; Lharamit got the key.
- Found Mallone’s journal: notes about local disputes:
    - Pollution feud between Bertrum (blacksmith) & Saria (stables).
    - Keggronites buying land, especially Strondabella.
    - Local farmer Marius suspicious of Keggronites.
    - Dhunta Rannacit: general complainer, disliked by Mallone.

## **Robin & Gralstak:**

- Investigated the tiefling Risgara.
- Gralstak barged in; Robin used _Charm Person_ and later _Sleep_.
- Tiefling’s house was messy, nothing suspicious, cutlery unused.

## **Lyra & Gralstak:**

- Questioned Bertrum the blacksmith.
- Lyra recreated the murder weapon with _Minor Illusion_.
- Bertrum couldn't identify it. Gralstak’s intimidation failed.

## **Threecie & Manmosu:**

- Questioned Dhunta (accuser).
- Complained about farms, land purchases, and town decline.
- Suspects Keggronites. Her wife Javu was polite but quiet.

- Jafrat suspected the tiefling; was polite but evasive.

# **Key Leads:**

- Mallone was investigating land disputes and political tensions in town.
- Multiple locals (especially Dhunta and Marius) suspect the Keggronites.
- Tiefling was likely a red herring, no clear evidence he was involved.
- No signs Mallone returned home after leaving the tavern.
