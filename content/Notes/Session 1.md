## The Party Assembles

*Meeting at [[The Owlbear Cub Tavern]], six strangers find themselves drawn together by circumstance and shared destinations.*

### **Party Members**

- **[[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]]**–4'5" brown-furred bunny with a fluffy mane and religious vestments. Acolyte of [[Shallandra]]
- **[[Threecie Novik|Threecie]]**–6'5" blue-scaled dragonborn with a glass eye and fully gloved arm. Mercenary on a mysterious errand
- **[[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]]**–5'8" nerdy human carrying a massive book, accompanied by her owl familiar. Dressed like a worn-out librarian, heading to study magic
- **[[Gralstak]]**–7'4" bald, greenish human in raggedy clothes, sporting a monocle and bristling with potions. Carries a surprisingly fancy greataxe and seeks strong allies
- **[[Manmosu]]**–Well-dressed Loxodon with a monocle and magnifying glass, constantly taking notes. Claims to be on a "sanctioned mission"
- **[[Robin Thaleia|Robin]]**–5'8" pretty, finely dressed, feminine-presenting human. Charismatic and particular about appearances, travelling to meet unspecified people

- **[[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] & [[Gralstak]]:** Met on the road during travel
- **[[Manmosu]] & [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]]:** Recent travelling companions

## **Tavern Events**

*The calm before the storm - establishing connections and observing the locals.*

- A tiefling man ([[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]]) drinking heavily and alone
- Middle-aged half-elf [[Mallone Ulaxidor]] (town lawmaster) in leather armour escorted the troubled tiefling out
- Minor tension arose from loud bar conversation involving [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] and [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]]
- The group bonded over shared travel plans and agreed to journey to **[[Aeremore]]** together

---

## **The Murder Discovery**

*Morning brings tragedy and suspicion to the small town.*

- **The Crime Scene:** [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] found dead in the street with a stab wound, notably no blood spatter present
- **First Responder:** [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] investigated the body, drawing accusations from townspeople of "returning to the scene"
- **Key Details:**
  - [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] had been dead for hours
  - Her rapier remained with the body, ruling out robbery
  - No signs she returned home after leaving the tavern
- **New Authority:** [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]], a nervous gnome deputy, left in charge
- **Town Response:** Immediate lockdown initiated, party volunteers to investigate

---

## **Investigation Highlights**

### **Lharamit & Manmosu**

- Investigated [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s house
- [[Manmosu]] tried to break in, [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] got the key
- Found [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s journal: notes about local disputes:
  - Pollution feud between [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]] (blacksmith) & [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]] (stables)
  - Keggronites buying land, especially [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]]
  - Local farmer [[Narchis Cloudbrow|Narchis]] suspicious of Keggronites
  - [[Dhunta Rannacit]]: general complainer, disliked by [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]

### **Robin & Gralstak**

- Investigated the tiefling [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]]
- [[Gralstak]] barged in, [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] used *Charm Person* and later *Sleep*
- His house was messy, nothing suspicious, cutlery unused

### **Lyra & Gralstak**

- Questioned [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]] the blacksmith
- [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] recreated the murder weapon with *Minor Illusion*
- [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]] couldn't identify it. [[Gralstak]]'s intimidation failed

### **Threecie & Manmosu**

- Questioned [[Dhunta Rannacit|Dhunta]] (accuser)
- Complained about farms, land purchases, and town decline
- Suspects Keggronites. Her wife [[Javu Rannacit|Javu]] was polite but quiet

### **[[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] & [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]]: The Keggronites**

- **Subjects:** [[Jafrak Keggranite|Jafrak]] and [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]]
- **[[Jafrak Keggranite|Jafrak]]'s Response:** Suspected the [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]], maintained politeness but remained evasive
- **[[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]]'s Behaviour:** Watchful and wary throughout the interaction
- **Strategic Interest:** [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] showed interest in their documents, [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] hinted at potential covert access but expressed uncertainty

---

## **Key Leads for Future Investigation**

- **Political Tensions:** [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] was actively investigating land disputes and growing political friction
- **Keggronite Suspicion:** Multiple locals ([[Dhunta Rannacit|Dhunta]], [[Narchis Cloudbrow|Narchis]]) harbor deep suspicions about the Keggronite family
- **Red Herring Theory:** [[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]] appears innocent based on lack of evidence
- **Missing Timeline:** No evidence suggests [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] returned home after the tavern incident
