## Journal Entry

We started the day with tension thick in the air. The murders in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] have left everyone on edge, and I could feel the weight of suspicion pressing on us all. [[Gralstak]] was already grumbling about the lawmaster's lack of progress, and [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] was, as ever, plotting something sneaky. I tried to keep my mind on the facts, but the uncertainty gnawed at me. I worried about what we might find, and whether we would be able to prove our innocence, let alone solve the case.

[[Gralstak]] wasted no time confronting [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]], trying to bribe and intimidate him into revealing something useful. It was uncomfortable to watch, and I felt a pang of sympathy for the poor gnome. Meanwhile, [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]] and [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] took a softer approach with [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]], but he was evasive, dodging questions about his time in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/index|Aeremore]] and why he really left. I could tell he was hiding something, but what?

[[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] and I tried to get into [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]]'s house. I sent [[Hooty]] in to look around, but all we found was a fidget toy and no sign of [[Mrs Cluckerson]]. It was frustrating, but at least we didn't get caught. With no more polite options left, we regrouped and decided to confront [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]] directly. [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] accused him of being a werewolf, and [[Gralstak]] grabbed him. That was when everything went to chaos. [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]] transformed, summoned a horde of werechickens, and attacked. [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] went down, but [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]] brought her back. In the end, we managed to subdue [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]], but the whole town must have heard the commotion.

I am left with more questions than answers. Why did Foxtrot return to [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]]? What happened in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/index|Aeremore]]? And where is [[Mrs Cluckerson]]? At least we know now that the murders were the work of a werewolf, but I fear this is only the beginning.
