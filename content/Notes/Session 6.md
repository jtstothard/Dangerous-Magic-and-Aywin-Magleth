## **Session 5 Recap: Key Points**

- **Jailbreak:** Lyra pickpocketed Marius's keys with _Unseen Servant_, escaped with Manmosu, who immediately left town claiming innocence
- **Intelligence:** Lyra raided Mallone's office, found surveillance notes on newcomers - especially Foxtrot being more fidgety and gaining "dexterity skills" in Aeremore
- **Bertrum Investigation:** Lharamit found a dagger and disturbing tongue-cutting drawing in his house, but escape went badly (fell through roof)
- **Party Split:** Robin used _Command_ on Gralstak; Threecie and Lharamit stormed off furious about mind-control magic
- **Consequences:** Robin and Lyra got official warnings from Marius; party is fractured over ethics
- **Current Status:** Manmosu gone, Foxtrot is main suspect, no murder weapon found, Lyra has master keys to town
