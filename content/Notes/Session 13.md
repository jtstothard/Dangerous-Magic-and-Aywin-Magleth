## Journal Entry

The sudden transition from [[People/NPCs/Legendary/Aywin Magleth|Aywin Magleth]]'s presence to a cramped, dark shed was jarring enough, but nothing could have prepared me for what greeted us on the other side. A horse stared at us through the window of a nearby farmhouse, which was peculiar enough until its owner called out asking if Aywin had sent us. When we confirmed this, he invited us in, and I understood immediately why Magleth had warned us not to stare.

[[People/NPCs/Cirrubi/Bear Cloudstripe|Bear Cloudstripe]] is a reverse centaur (a horse's head atop a human torso and legs). The sight was so startling that I had to consciously avoid gaping. He explained that he owed Magleth a favour and thus his home served as a teleportation point. The arrangement seemed mutually beneficial: Bear received magical assistance, and Magleth gained a discreet travel hub a day's journey from [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cirrubi/index|Cirrubi|Cirrubi]]. Bear warned us that we'd have to make our own way back, as he doesn't handle teleportation himself.

The walk toward Cirrubi began peacefully enough, but my routine magical surveillance revealed something deeply troubling. There was an Illusion magic affecting [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]]'s face (not a disguise exactly, but something that made his features seem familiar in the way of half-remembered dreams). My first terrifying thought was that [[People/NPCs/Legendary/Aywin Magleth|Aywin Magleth]] had somehow infiltrated our party, disguising himself as Robin to monitor our mission. When I confronted him about it, his genuine confusion was evident. He truly had no idea about the magical effect, which made it all the more concerning. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]]'s assessment was sobering: for an illusion to persist this long without the subject's knowledge would require extraordinarily powerful magic.

The revelation sparked an uncomfortable discussion about loyalties and trust. [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]] seemed particularly wary of our association with Magleth, while [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]] appeared almost starstruck by our encounter with the legendary wizard. The dynamics within our group continue to shift as we grapple with the implications of the forces we're becoming entangled with.

Our contemplations were interrupted by the sound of angry shouting ahead. A gnomish figure stood on a ridge, berating two massive Ogres who were struggling to erect a tent. A Lizardfolk and an Orc stood nearby, apparently serving as guards. [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]]'s reaction was immediate and visceral (her hand began suggesting violence, and she had to actively resist the urge to attack). Even [[Thanatos]] seemed agitated, circling overhead and barking at the group.

[[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]] volunteered to investigate, but the gnome's response to his polite inquiry was pure hostility. When Robin attempted to cast a spell in retaliation, the gnome struck back with Eldritch magic, revealing himself to be a Warlock. What followed was a chaotic battle that tested every member of our group.

The Warlock proved to be a formidable opponent, deflecting [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]]'s Eldritch Blast to one of his own guards and showing unusual resistance to Enchantment magic. His apparent fixation on [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]] was disturbing (he seemed drawn to her in a way that suggested some deeper magical connection). The devastating strike he landed on her with his own Eldritch Blast nearly ended her involvement in the fight entirely.

[[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]] proved his worth by finishing the Warlock with a Thunderwave that also caught one of the guards. The remaining guards immediately surrendered, explaining they were merely hired muscle with no investment in their employer's hostile behaviour. The Ogres, freed from whatever compulsion had bound them to the Warlock's service, were easily dealt with through a combination of my Web spell and concentrated fire from the group.

The encounter left me with several troubling questions. The Warlock's immediate hostility seemed disproportionate to [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]]'s polite approach. His supernatural resistance to certain spells and his fixation on [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]] suggested he was more than a simple thug. Was this encounter coincidental, or are we already being hunted by forces connected to our mission in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cirrubi/index|Cirrubi|Cirrubi]]?

As we continue toward the bureaucratic heart of the former [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/index|Aswesh]] capital, I can't shake the feeling that the Illusion on [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]]'s face and this unprovoked attack are connected to larger forces at play. The threads of conspiracy that began with the [[Organisations/Pashae Institute|Pashae Institute]] seem to be drawing us ever deeper into a web we don't yet fully understand.
