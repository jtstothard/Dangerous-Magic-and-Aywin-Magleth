## **Current Investigation Leads**

### **High Priority Suspects**

**[[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]]'s Secrets**

- Demonstrated knowledge about werechickens beyond normal citizen awareness
- Emotional reaction suggests personal connection to lycanthropic creatures
- Recent return to town coincides with escalating supernatural incidents
- Potential connection to [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] or forest activities

**[[Risgara Geraves|Risgara]]'s Disappearance**

- Original drunk at tavern, potentially red herring or deliberate misdirection
- Apartment searches revealed no recent habitation

### **Missing Key Evidence**

**[[Mrs Cluckerson]] Investigation**

- Possibly the original infected creature or patient zero
- Could be roaming as transformed werechicken
- Might hold clues to infection source or method

**Forest Trail Analysis**

- [[Zymis Wenben|Zymis]]'s body location had nearby blood trail evidence
- Could lead to werewolf den, transformation site, or secondary crime scene
- [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]]'s obstruction prevented thorough examination
- Independent investigation required

### **Political Investigations**

**[[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] & [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] Alliance**

- Coordinated arrest attempt suggests deeper cooperation
- Could indicate cover-up, panic response, or direct involvement
- [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]]'s business documents merit further examination
- Power dynamics shifting rapidly in town leadership

**Lycanthropic Knowledge Sources**

- Church records might contain historical lycanthropy incidents
- [[Dhunta Rannacit|Dhunta]] could possess local folklore or family knowledge
- Old books or town archives may document previous outbreaks
- Precedent for werechickens needs investigation

### **Character Alibis & Connections**

**[[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]] & [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]]**

- Romantic relationship provides mutual alibis for multiple incidents
- [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]]'s magical heritage (half air genasi) could be relevant

## **Supernatural Threat Analysis**

### **Confirmed Lycanthropic Activity**

- **Werechicken Outbreak:** Artificially created through deliberate infection process
- **Werewolf Presence:** At least one shapeshifter capable of strategic planning and human-form murders
- **Infection Vector:** Large creature biting chickens intentionally to spread lycanthropy

### **Strategic Implications**

- **Timing Coordination:** Incidents occurring in sequence suggest intelligent planning rather than random attacks
- **Political Manipulation:** Supernatural threats coinciding with political instability indicates possible coordination
- **Information Control:** Official channels compromised, requiring independent investigation methods

### **Unresolved Questions**

- **Original Source:** What creature or person initiated the lycanthropic infections?
- **Motivation:** Political destabilization, personal revenge, or external threat?
- **Scope:** How many townspeople might be infected or involved?
- **Connection:** Relationship between [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]'s murder and lycanthropic outbreak timing?

## **Next Session Priorities**

### **Immediate Actions Required**

3. **[[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]] Confrontation:** Extract full truth about his lycanthropic knowledge
4. **[[Mrs Cluckerson]] Search:** Locate missing chicken, potentially transformed

### **Information Gathering**

1. **Lycanthropic Research:** Consult church, archives, or local experts for historical precedent
2. **Political Documents:** Access [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]]'s correspondence and business records
3. **Alibi Verification:** Cross-reference timing of all suspects during key incidents
4. **Authority Structure:** Determine legitimate leadership in [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]]'s absence

### **Strategic Considerations**
