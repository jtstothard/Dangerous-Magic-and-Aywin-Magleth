## Journal Entry

Imprisoned with [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]], I found myself oddly calm. [[Manmosu]] was disgruntled and eager to leave town, insisting he'd never killed anyone himself. I tried to keep the mood light, complimenting [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Marius Ligroves|Marius Ligroves]] on the jail, which only made him threaten to make things worse. Still, I was not worried. When Marius left, I used *Unseen Servant* to steal his keys. My first attempts at escape were clumsy, but eventually [[Manmosu]] managed to slip away. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] and [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie Novik]] saw him go, but the party decided not to intervene.

Once free, I searched [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone Ulaxidor]]'s office for clues. Her notes on [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot Fowler]] and the [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/Buildings/Brightroot Apartments|Brightroot Apartments]] residents were meticulous. She trusted [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Amara Tallbloom|Amara Tallbloom]] above all, and suspected [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Saria Tallbloom|Saria Tallbloom]] was cleverer than she let on. The Cloudbrow family's tensions and the Keggronite ambitions were all documented.

The party regrouped at [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/Buildings/Greyson Tools|Greyson Tools]] to investigate [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum Greyson]]. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] tried to pick the lock, but I provided [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Marius Ligroves|Marius]]'s keys. [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin Thaleia]] and [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie Novik]] distracted [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]] while I used *Unseen Servant* to search the river for the murder weapon, unsuccessfully. [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] found a dagger in [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]]'s bedroom, but it was unclear if it had been used recently. A disturbing drawing of a tongue being cut was also discovered.

Tensions flared as [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] demanded to see weapons and tried to take daggers as evidence, leading to a dramatic scene and our eventual ejection from the shop. [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] used her escape route to visit [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Saria Tallbloom|Saria Tallbloom]] at the stables, discussing werechickens and alibis. [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]] was unusually honest, and [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]] confirmed their alibi.

Back together, the party argued over magical ethics. [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]] and [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] were furious with [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] for using mind-affecting spells, and [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]]'s trauma surfaced. [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] and [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]] arrived to investigate, issuing official warnings to [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] and me for magical misconduct. I kept mine as a souvenir.

Despite our efforts, so many questions remain: the true nature of the lycanthropy, the missing murder weapon, and who can be trusted in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]]. [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]] remains a primary suspect, but nothing is certain.
