## Journal Entry

I had hoped today would be less fraught, but the air between [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]] and me still crackled with tension from our last argument. As we approached the gates of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cirrubi/index|Cirrubi]], I quietly created an Emboldening Bond on him, a small gesture, but one I hoped would serve as a peace offering. Maybe, if nothing else, it would remind him that I want us to work together, not against each other.

Getting into the city was easier than expected, thanks to [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]]'s quick thinking and a set of forged documents. [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] handed his vials of blood to [[People/Party/Pets/Thanatos|Thanatos]] for safekeeping, and [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] managed to pass off the arcane remains she carries as research material, much to the guards' horror.

Inside the [[Organisations/Cirrubi Central Bureaucracy|Cirrubi Central Bureaucracy]], [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]]'s charm was on full display. He spun a tale about a special investigation for the crownsguard, and before I knew it, we had a guard escorting us through the maze of records. I could feel the weight of the place, so many secrets, so much dust, and the faintest whiff of something rotten lingering in the air.

We split up to search. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] dove into the archives, looking for anything about her family. She found a report, but it had been magically doctored; she pocketed it, determined to unravel the truth. She also uncovered an old case from [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Penketh|Penketh]] involving a soul-sucking incident, and a lead on blood magic in a town called [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Druzodd|Druzodd]].

Meanwhile, the rest of us looked into city plans and recent break-ins. We learned about a month-old incident: a sapphire dragonborn and a harengon broke in, killed a guard named [[Terry]], and vanished without a trace. The report was still open, but no one seemed to know what, if anything, had been taken.

That smell in the archives kept nagging at me. I followed it to a suspicious file, and as I opened it, a magical glyph flared to life. The lights dimmed, and [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]]'s undead-sensing lantern began to glow, shadows coalesced, and a portal opened. A huge zombie began to emerge. So much for a quiet day.
