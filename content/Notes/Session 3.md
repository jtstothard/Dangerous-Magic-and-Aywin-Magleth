# Investigation continued

## **Barn Stakeout**

- **[[Gralstak]]** and **[[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]]** staked out the Cloudbrow barn at night, suspecting strange activity inside
- [[Gralstak]] tried (poorly) to ask **[[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]]** for a key to hide inside. She declined. Lyra stepped in to help but got the same answer
- The pair hid around the side of the barn with poor cover. [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] felt disliked by [[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]], while [[Gralstak]] thought the opposite

## **Interrogating Danlas**

- **[[Threecie Novik|Threecie]]** and **[[Manmosu]]** visited **[[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]]**, saying they were reporting back to [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]]
- [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] claimed [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] was out and seemed confident that [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] would soon become lawmaster
- Blamed [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]] for escalating conflict and praised the Keggronites, saying things have been peaceful since

---

## **Snooping Marius' House**

- **[[Robin Thaleia|Robin]]** and **[[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]]** snuck into the [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]] and [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] household while the others distracted [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]]
- [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] misty stepped into the house, made a noise, and pretended a loom had fallen to cover his presence
- [[Manmosu]] tried distracting **[[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]]** with magic (Command and Prestidigitation), but [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] became suspicious
- [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]] helped [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] reset the loom, playing innocent
- [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] found [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]]’ diary
    - Mostly mundane, complaining about his dad and being overlooked
    - Mentions helping a drunk **[[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]]** home, but nothing incriminating
    - Notes [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] and [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]]’s prolonged stay in town as odd
- [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] also found letters in [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]]’ room. Bureaucratic in nature, including rental and expansion discussions from the Keggronites
- [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] escaped through the window, helped by [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] who laid down a blanket

## **The Werechicken Attack**

- **[[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]]** and **[[Gralstak]]** heard banging inside the barn, with the chain rattling
- [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] sent **[[Hooty]]** to scout, spotting chickens trying to break out
- The front door burst open. **Combat began**
- Chickens were infected and transforming. **Werechickens**. Spreading infection by pecking each other
- **[[Hooty]]** alerted the rest of the party, who rushed to help

**Combat Highlights**

- Chickens resisted multiple hits, particularly one that dodged 3 players
- [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] used **Silvery Barbs** on [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]]’s would-be killing blow due to her own self-consciousness, resulting in [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] blasting **[[Manmosu]]** instead
- [[Gralstak]] eventually splattered the chicken. [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]] cleaned up with **Eldritch Blasts**, and **[[Manmosu]]** finished off the sleeping chickens with **Thunderwave**
- [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]] was notably sharper in tone during combat. [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] noticed this as more of her authentic self

---

## **Session Highlights**

- **[[Threecie Novik|Threecie]]**: Stylishly savage Eldritch Blasts and sharp-tongued commentary
- **[[Manmosu]]**: Pissed off [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]] with magic, then dramatically stormed out
- **[[Robin Thaleia|Robin]]**: Snuck through a house, and found lots of documents
- **[[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]]**: Considered arson as a solution and felt guilty enough to sabotage a party member’s kill
- **[[Gralstak]]**: Got launched by chickens and failed at negotiation
- **[[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]]**: Played support, healed [[Manmosu]], and laid a blanket for [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]]’s daring escape
