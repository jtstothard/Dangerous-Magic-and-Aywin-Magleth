# Investigation continued

## **Barn Stakeout**

- **Gralstak** and **Lyra** staked out the Cloudbrow barn at night, suspecting strange activity inside
- Gralstak tried (poorly) to ask **Risgex** for a key to hide inside. She declined. Lyra stepped in to help but got the same answer
- The pair hid around the side of the barn with poor cover. Lyra felt disliked by Risgex, while Gralstak thought the opposite

## **Interrogating Danlas**

- **Threecie** and **Manmosu** visited **Danlas**, saying they were reporting back to Marrius
- Danlas claimed Marrius was out and seemed confident that Marrius would soon become lawmaster
- Blamed Mallone for escalating conflict and praised the Keggronites, saying things have been peaceful since

---

## **Snooping Marrius' House**

- **Robin** and **Lharamit** snuck into the Marrius and Danlas household while the others distracted Danlas
- Robin misty stepped into the house, made a noise, and pretended a loom had fallen to cover her presence
- Manmosu tried distracting **Danlas** with magic (Command and Prestidigitation), but Danlas became suspicious
- Threecie helped Danlas reset the loom, playing innocent
- Robin found Marrius’ diary
    - Mostly mundane, complaining about his dad and being overlooked
    - Mentions helping a drunk **Risgex** home, but nothing incriminating
    - Notes Lharamit and Threecie’s prolonged stay in town as odd
- Robin also found letters in Danlas’ room. Bureaucratic in nature, including rental and expansion discussions from the Keggronites
- Robin escaped through the window, helped by Lharamit who laid down a blanket

## **The Werechicken Attack**

- **Lyra** and **Gralstak** heard banging inside the barn, with the chain rattling
- Lyra sent **Hooty** to scout, spotting chickens trying to break out
- The front door burst open. **Combat began**
- Chickens were infected and transforming. **Werechickens**. Spreading infection by pecking each other
- **Hooty** alerted the rest of the party, who rushed to help

**Combat Highlights**

- Chickens resisted multiple hits, particularly one that dodged 3 players
- Lyra used **Silvery Barbs** on Lharamit’s would-be killing blow due to her own self-consciousness, resulting in Lharamit blasting **Manmosu** instead
- Gralstak eventually splattered the chicken. Threecie cleaned up with **Eldritch Blasts**, and **Manmosu** finished off the sleeping chickens with **Thunderwave**
- Threecie was notably sharper in tone during combat. Lharamit noticed this as more of her authentic self

---

## **Session Highlights**

- **Threecie**: Stylishly savage Eldritch Blasts and sharp-tongued commentary
- **Manmosu**: Pissed off Danlas with magic, then dramatically stormed out
- **Robin**: Argued with a chicken, snuck through a house, and found lots of beige documents
- **Lyra**: Considered arson as a solution and felt guilty enough to sabotage a party member’s kill
- **Gralstak**: Got launched by chickens and failed at negotiation
- **Lharamit**: Played support, healed Manmosu, and laid a blanket for Robin’s daring escape
