## Journal Entry

The night at the [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/Buildings/Cloudbrow Farm & Barn|Cloudbrow Barn]] began with a sense of unease. [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] and I were assigned to surveillance, hoping to catch the intruder who had broken in before. [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex Cloudbrow]] refused to give us a key, so we hid outside, nerves on edge. Meanwhile, [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie Novik]], [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]], [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin Thaleia]], and [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne]] pursued leads at the Ligroves Household, digging into [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Danlas Ligroves|Danlas Ligroves]]'s ambitions and the [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Strondabella Keggranite|Keggronites]]' business dealings.

The barn was quiet until the banging and rattling began. I sent [[Hooty|Hooty]] to scout, and she saw the chickens acting strangely. Suddenly, the doors burst open and chaos erupted, chickens were transforming into werechickens, attacking each other and us. I panicked and used *Silvery Barbs* on [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne]]'s attack, which backfired and hurt [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]]. [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] fought bravely, [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie Novik]] was ruthless with her magic, and [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]] finished the fight with a thunderous spell. The confined space and the speed of the chickens made everything more difficult.

Afterwards, we regrouped and compared notes. [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin Thaleia]] and [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne]] had found suspicious documents linking the [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Strondabella Keggranite|Keggronites]] to the Ligroves Household. [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie Novik]]'s sharpness in combat surprised me, and [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]]'s magical force was overwhelming. I am left wondering about the source of the infection, the fate of [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Mrs Cluckerson|Mrs Cluckerson]], and whether all of this ties back to [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone Ulaxidor]]'s murder. The threads are tangled, and I am not sure where they will lead next.
