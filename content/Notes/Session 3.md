## **The [[Cloudbrow Farm & Barn|Barn]] Stakeout**

*What began as a simple surveillance operation quickly turned into something far more dangerous.*

### **Team Assignment & Preparation**

- **Surveillance Team:** [[Gralstak]] and [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]]
- **Initial Plan:** Hide inside the barn to observe any intruders
- **Complication:** [[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]] refused to provide a key when [[Gralstak]] made a poorly executed request
- **Backup Plan:** External surveillance from makeshift hiding spots around the barn's perimeter

---

## **The Werechicken Outbreak**

### **Combat Highlights**

#### **Individual Performances**

- **[[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]]'s Critical Error:** Used *Silvery Barbs* on [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]]'s killing blow due to personal embarrassment, causing [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] to accidentally blast [[Manmosu]] instead
- **[[Gralstak]]'s Finale:** Eventually splattered the most resilient chicken after taking significant damage
- **[[Threecie Novik|Threecie]]'s Precision:** Efficiently eliminated multiple targets with well-aimed *Eldritch Blasts*
