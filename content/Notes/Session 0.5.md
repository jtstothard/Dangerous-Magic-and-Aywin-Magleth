- Headed to [[Aeremore]] to learn about magic and to uncover some truths around why the two peace nations split
- Parents offered me passage on a ship moving military supplies up the coast, I refused as I wanted to go my own way
- Headed into to [[Kespice]] to find a way to cross to [[Aswen]], I paid for travel on a boat but later realised it was a pirate vessel
- They raided other ships and pillaged, but I was always kept safe and assured of my passage
- Held at the border of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/index|Aswesh]] to check all my belongings
- Met [[Gralstak]], he was covered in bottles of potions, arguing with the border guard about letting him in, he took a potion, i asked lots of questions
- We’re both heading to [[Aeremore]] so travelled together
- Attacked by half orc and their bore Betsy, we killed them both to survive. I stripped the bore for meat as I had read in a book one time
- Heading into [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]] for next session
