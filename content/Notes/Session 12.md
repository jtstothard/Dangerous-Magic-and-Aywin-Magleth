## Journal Entry

The weight of our actions at the [[Organisations/Pashae Institute|Pashae Institute]] settled heavily on us as we returned to the [[Organisations/Adventuring Parties/index|Adventurers' League]] headquarters. [[People/NPCs/Aeremore/Adventurer's League/Maccario Bulen|Maccario]] was less than pleased with our methods, though I can't say I blamed him entirely. Breaking into a benefactor's facility doesn't exactly scream "diplomatic relations." Still, when a child's life hangs in the balance, bureaucratic niceties feel rather hollow.

[[People/NPCs/Aeremore/Adventurer's League/Missions/Abel Milhaud|Abel]] woke weak but coherent, and his account of the ordeal was deeply disturbing. The [[Organisations/Pashae Institute|institute]] had been forcing him into magical situations (illusions, perhaps) where he'd have to cast spells to survive, then draining his blood afterward. The methodical cruelty of it made my skin crawl. [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]]'s magical detection revealed that [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]] shared a similar magical aura to [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]], though significantly weakened by his ordeal. It seems they were harvesting sorcerous blood like some twisted magical battery.

What followed was typical [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]]. Armed with samples of [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]]'s blood, he descended into [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]]'s workplace (a mortuary, naturally) to conduct his experiments. The man has an unsettling enthusiasm for consuming bodily fluids. He managed to determine that sorcerer blood functions as a kind of magical storage, but his methods involved drinking werewolf blood and sampling everyone else's. I volunteered mine for the cause, though I drew the line at his more enthusiastic suggestions. The taste of decay he detected in [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]]'s blood was particularly troubling, evidence of whatever dark magic had been worked upon him.

With our membership in the [[Organisations/Adventuring Parties/index|Adventurers' League]] now official (pending 50 gold each, naturally), we found ourselves presented with another contract. The name Mary Finsworth meant nothing to us, but the theft of architectural plans from the [[Organisations/Cirrubi Central Bureaucracy|Cirrubi Central Bureaucracy]] struck a familiar chord. These were the same plans that had supposedly been stolen by people matching our descriptions.

Meeting Mary was peculiar. The halfling woman's home felt wrong, like a stage set rather than a lived-in space. [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]]'s magical sight confirmed what my instincts suspected: she was wrapped in illusion magic. When she invited us into her bedroom, the flash of white light that followed should have been warning enough.

We found ourselves face to face with [[People/NPCs/Legendary/Aywin Magleth|Aywin Magleth]] himself. The elven wizard was everything the stories suggested: powerful, enigmatic, and deeply unsettling. When [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]] demanded proof of his identity, Magleth's response was swift and absolute. One gesture, and we were all unconscious.

What followed was perhaps the most invasive experience of my life. I found myself in a church that felt familiar yet wrong, watching versions of myself deliver sermons while my sister's dissenting voice echoed from the congregation. My parents sat behind me in their formal robes, and I could feel the weight of their expectations, their restrictions on my teachings. Magleth observed it all with clinical interest, noting my desire to break free from their control, to find my own path away from their shadow.

The others endured their own psychological excavations. [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]] was subjected to a theatrical performance of his past, his search for something lost. [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] found himself in a destroyed laboratory, his heartbreak and thirst for revenge laid bare. [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]] faced a council of his own conflicting emotions (anger, greed, and bravado warring at a twisted round table). [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] wandered through a library of her life, her doubts about her family and her complicated relationship with the [[Cathedral]] exposed. And [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]] found herself on an autopsy table while Magleth examined her heart, revealing both her connection to some mysterious order and the necrotic corruption she carries.

When we woke, Magleth seemed satisfied. He'd confirmed we had no rigid ties to the Pentaturres and could be useful allies. The missing plans, it turned out, were for [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/Buildings/Magleth Manor|Magleth Manor]] itself, though he claimed no responsibility for the theft or the use of our likenesses. He offered assistance with our various goals, noting that none of them conflicted with his interests. The comment about potentially turning [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] from the [[Cathedral]] was particularly pointed.

Now we find ourselves equipped with a potion of seeming and a mission to infiltrate [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cirrubi|Cirrubi]]. The warning about [[People/NPCs/Cirrubi/Bear Cloudstripe|Bear Cloudstripe]] ("don't stare") feels ominous. Whatever awaits us in the bureaucratic heart of the former [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/index|Aswesh]] capital, I suspect it will test more than just our diplomatic skills.

The threads of conspiracy grow ever more tangled, and I can't shake the feeling that we're being drawn deeper into something far larger than we realise.
