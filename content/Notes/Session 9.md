## Journal Entry

It's strange how a missing person's case can feel so ordinary and so tangled at the same time. We started in [[Maccario Bulen]]'s office, the usual mix of nerves and anticipation in the air. The job was simple on paper: find [[Abel Milhaud]], a sixteen year old tiefling who's been missing for a couple of weeks. But nothing is ever simple in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/index|Aeremore]].

We headed to [[Outer Osterford]], following the address given by [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]]'s mother, [[Jezebel Milhaud]]. Her home was cramped, cluttered with wood shavings and the scent of wood work. [[Jezebel Milhaud]] herself was tired but sharp, not surprised to see us. She told us [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]] had been going out at night, coming back with money he wouldn't explain. They'd moved here with her and her ex-husband, [[Methuselah Milhaud]], from South [[Aswen]]. [[Methuselah Milhaud|Methuselah]] left soon after.

Searching [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]]'s room, we found some gold hidden away and a strange note, part cipher, part spell, maybe a poem. [[Lyra Shadowflame|My]] detect magic revealed faint traces of evocation and illusion, cast regularly but nothing overtly magical left behind. The rocks on his windowsill were more telling: sulphurous, silicate, and phosphorous, all worn from use, with a space for a missing fourth. [[Lyra Shadowflame|I]] recognised them as components for cantrips like Dancing Lights, and possibly more dangerous spells. [[Jezebel Milhaud|Jezebel]] mentioned [[Methuselah Milhaud|Methuselah]] had tried to make money selling volatile magical rocks, the kind found in South [[Loshium]] and North [[Spuaburg]]. dangerous stuff, something i'd heard all too much about from my parents as they recounted the acts of terrorism that the people of [[Loshium]] conducted on my nation.

We canvassed the area. [[Robin Thaleia]] and [[Gralstak]] went door to door, learning [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]] had been busking with magic in [[Inner Osterford]]. [[Lyra Shadowflame|I]] checked the scroll shop, no sign of [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]] buying scrolls, but [[Knig Neg]]'s Nic Nacks yielded a receipt for quartz and a gnome shopkeeper who seemed to know more than he let on. [[Gralstak]] traded werewolf blood for information, but we stole it back, far too valuable to leave in the hands of someone so untrustworthy.

[[Threecie Novik|Threecie]] took a crack at the ciphered note, suspecting it was more than just a code, maybe a spell or a set of instructions. [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]], ever the investigator, attuned to [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]]'s missing lodestones and cast Locate Object. The result: a ping from the [[Pashae Institute]], an alchemical school in the Pentaturres, run by [[Erhand Pashae]] from [[Spuaburg]], someone I had heard of growing up but left when I was young.

The day ended with more questions than answers. [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]]'s lodestones are close, but why are they at the [[Pashae Institute]]? What was [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]] really up to with those rocks? And what's the real story behind his sudden magical aptitude and mysterious earnings?
