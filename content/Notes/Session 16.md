## Journal Entry

We barely had time to catch our breath after the chaos in the archives. Shadows still lingered from the undead attack, and the group was tense, shaken but determined to press on. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]]'s channel divinity had scattered the undead, and [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]]'s magic finished the job, leaving the remains of the zombie and shadow creatures behind. I felt a mix of relief and unease as we searched the aftermath for answers.

At one point, [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]] was carried around by the giant zombie, and I had to hide in a rope trick to avoid being caught in the chaos. It was a close call, but we managed to regroup and press on.

We found a collection of site and floor plans, but the details didn't add up. Pages were missing, the numbering was off, and a wizard's sigil marked one of the documents like a magical signature. [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]] tore out the sigil page, leaving the archive damaged and our actions obvious. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] and I debated whether to take the plans, knowing it would make us suspects. [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] searched for anything about his village but came up empty, settling for a random book instead.

Before we could investigate further, museum guards arrived. [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]] quickly claimed we were on a crown guard investigation, spinning a story to buy us time. The guards were suspicious but let us leave, escorted by the one who still seemed to trust us.

We regrouped at the [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/Towns/Cirrubi/Buildings/Mellow Lodge Diner|Mellow Lodge Diner]] for a short rest. [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] insisted on lasagne, [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]] performed a song of rest, and we tried to keep our illusions hidden in a private booth. The prices were high, but the break was needed.

[[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]] and [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]] went to the [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/Towns/Cirrubi/Buildings/Worthless Skunk Pub|Worthless Skunk pub]] to look for information about the break-in. [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] found a boxing gym in the outer city. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]], [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]], and I went to the police office. The city was tense, with guards stopping people and handing out notes, worried about suspects fleeing. At the police office, we learned more items were missing and our cover story had been exposed. The investigation is more complicated than we thought, and I'm left wondering what we've gotten ourselves into.
