chapter 17 oops we're nicked

whoopsie we're being arrested. we managed to say hey we're here to help prommieee. we told them about being mercenaries for aywen magleth looking into his lost plans. being detained for questioning. lyra said she's gralstak from gralstak's home, lharamit gave a fake name but said where she was from, threecie said she was triple a (not true) from from oreon (true). mrs cluckerson is on stage tonight.

manmosu is gralstak's conscience (manmosu cast message and said maybe dont walk right into the guards stopping people). gralstak wondering if he will have to start feeding the poor. robin says manmosu is a man of great influence. manmosu says he is not going anywhere near those guards and robin is incredulous that he expects robin to get gralstak out alone. robin suggesting it'll be fine once the seaming wears off. manmosu wondering if he can dumbo his way out of this, robin like sure u want to look like a dumbass, sure whatever.

robin tries to climb up on some houses and considering climbing the walls to the outer city. realises there's a bunch of city guards manning the wall. meanwhile gralstak walks right on up to the cops. asking whats going on but trying to imply he is a man of rank. the cop says oh we're looking for uh. um. uh. uhh. um someone who looks a lot like you, sir. gralstak said he just has one of those faces, asked if they need a hand. things went bad so gralstak punched them. to death. and books it

davis is dead.

crossbowmen on the wall shoot at gralstak while he runs. robin cast sleep on some of the pigs following him. robin and manmosu succeed in using the distraction to sneak to the outer city. thanatos speaking to them, passing over the sigil page and saying we'll rendezvous outside the city where that horrible gnome gave u a rock.

lharamit lyra and threecie planning a dramatic escape (hopefully not dramatic) (our hopes fail). stuck in a conference room with two guards at the door, lharamit cast silence on the door area while the other two KO'd the guards, then lyra cast an illusion over the door while we blasted it. threecie made lharamit and herself invisible to try n escape while lyra made a fog cloud. stuff did not go well. but we did in fact get out. threecie is invisible so gonna go get outta here. lyra successfully flew away. lharamit managed to shake off the pursuing guards and went to go hide in a pub til the seaming wears off, bribed the pub staff to keep it hush.

highlights:
gralstak for decking a guy so hard he just straight up died
robin for stopping manmosu from flying over the wall covered in crossbow people
manmosu and robin for a great deal of banter around the planning
lyra as gralstak being gralstak. and a gralstak illusion rocking in the corner after hearing gralstak killed someone
lharamit for refusing to leave until knowing we were all getting out
threecie for managing to sneak out after going unconscious and managing to pretend to still be to run away later
