## Journal Entry

We started the day by the river behind [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]]'s forge, the air thick with tension. Determined to find the missing dagger, [[Gralstak]] and I searched for any discarded weapon, noticing that the river would be a great place to hide this. I joked with [[Hooty]] that she may have to come back as a fix to search for it. I could not shake the feeling that we were missing something crucial. [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] and [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] were already discussing risky plans about breaking into the Keggronite Residence, but caution won out for now.

At [[Tallbloom Stables]], the atmosphere was heavy. [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]]'s frustration with [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]] was obvious, and [[Amara Tallbloom|Amara]]'s nervousness made me uneasy. It took [[Gralstak]]'s intimidation to get Amara to admit that [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]] had visited Syndra during the night. The family's struggles, caught between [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]]'s influence and [[Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum]]'s pollution, felt like a microcosm of the whole town. I felt for [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]], trapped by her mother's expectations.

Later, at the [[Cloudbrow Farm & Barn]], [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]], [[Manmosu]], and I tried to untangle the family's secrets. My attempt at a distraction spell failed, making [[Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]] even more suspicious of us. [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]] eventually confessed to being with [[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]] all night, which was a relief, but it left us with more questions. The break-in at the [[Cloudbrow Farm & Barn|Cloudbrow Barn]] and the disappearance of [[Mrs Cluckerson]] added another layer of mystery. [[Narchis Cloudbrow|Narchis]]'s theory about the chicken running off to the city almost made me laugh, but the picked lock was no joke.

As night fell, I volunteered to watch the barn. I am not sure if I am being brave or reckless. There are so many threads left dangling: [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]]'s return, [[Danlas Ligroves|Danlas]]'s ambitions for [[Marius Ligroves|Marius]], and the ever-present shadow of the Keggronites. I cannot shake the feeling that something big is coming, and I am not sure we are ready.
