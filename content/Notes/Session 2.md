## Investigation Continues

### **[[Gralstak]] & [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]]: River Search**

- **Location:** River behind the blacksmith's forge
- **Environment:** Narrow, deep, but slow-moving water
- **Analysis:** Any dropped dagger would likely sink nearby rather than drift
- **Results:** No weapon recovered despite thorough search
- **Side Notes:**
  - [[Gralstak]] took the opportunity to wash his clothes following [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]]'s earlier comments about his appearance
  - [[Lyra Shadowflame|Lyra]] jokingly warned [[Hooty]] he might need to become aquatic soon

### **[[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] & [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]]: Strategic Planning**

- **Consideration:** Breaking into the Keggronite residence

- **[[Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]]'s Perspective:**

  - Resistant to her mother's pressure to leave, believing [[Saria Tallbloom|Saria]] will find fault regardless
