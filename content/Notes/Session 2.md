# Investigation continued
## **Gralstak & Lyra: River Investigation**

- Investigated the river behind the blacksmith
- Narrow and deep, but slow moving. A dagger wouldn’t drift far, likely sank
- No weapon found
- Gralstak washed his clothes after Robin’s comments
- Lyra quietly told Hooty he might have to become a fish soon

---

## **Lharamit & Robin: Keggronite Discussion**

- Considered sneaking into the Keggronite home
- Decided against it for now as too risky without a clear goal

---

## **The Stables – Tallbloom Family**

**People Present:**

- **Saria** middle aged elf, stable owner
- **Amara** young adult (they/them), Saria’s child
- **Syndra** teen daughter (she/her)

**Key Info:**

- Stables not owned by the Keggronites, one of the few local businesses left
- Horses present belong to Strondabella, hired out to villagers
- Bertrum’s forge pollution is affecting the horses
- Saria dislikes the blacksmith and wants Syndra to leave and find work
- Gralstak exaggerated his hatred for Bertrum to win favour

**Knife Investigation:**

- Gralstak examined Saria’s hoofing knife, very dirty, unlikely murder weapon
- Syndra’s knife was cleaner but showed no signs of use

**Conversations:**

- Syndra admired Mallone and said she was someone you could have a drink with
- Syndra doesn’t want to leave, thinks Saria will find something to nag about regardless
- Robin made an odd remark about mothers and grew flustered when Lharamit and Syndra noticed
- Amara lied about not hearing anything, intimidated by Gralstak into revealing Shayee was over last night visiting Syndra
- Amara doesn’t want Saria to know due to her being heteronormative and unaccepting

**Party:** Threecie, Lyra, Manmosu

- Overheard Risgex (Shayee’s parent) asking someone where they were last night
- Risgex (silver dragonborn) greeted the party
    - Believes everyone was home but knows Shayee sneaks out sometimes
    - Dislikes Strondabella and believes she’d pay someone else to commit murder
    - Suggested it could be someone from Brightroot Apartments as they’re less known in town
- Shayee (half air genasi, silver dragonborn appearance)

    - Lyra tried Minor Illusion to distract, Risgex noticed and is now suspicious
    - Threecie pulled Shayee aside and got the truth
        - Was with Syndra last night
        - Didn’t notice anything strange, just avoided being caught
        - Used to drink with Mallone
        - Said Mallone didn’t get on with Keggronites, Bertrum, Saria, and Darius
