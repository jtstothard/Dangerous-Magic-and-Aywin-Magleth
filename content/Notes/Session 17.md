## Journal Entry

I suppose I should have expected it, but being arrested was not how I imagined the day would go. The city felt tense, the air thick with suspicion after the chaos in the archives. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]], [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]], and I ended up at the police station in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/Towns/Cirrubi/index|Cirrubi]], still clinging to our cover stories, blissfully unaware that we'd already been reported. When the guards started asking questions, we did what we do best - improvised. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] gave a fake name, [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]] spun a tale about being "Triple A" from Oreon, and I, for reasons I can't quite explain, claimed to be [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] from Gralstak's home. It was almost comical, if not for the cold conference room and the guards waiting to arrest the rest of our party.

Meanwhile, [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] was off to find a boxing ring, hoping to burn off some energy. Instead, he was stopped at the city gates, questioned about the archive incident. Things escalated quickly, Gralstak tried to bluff his way out, but when that failed, he punched a guard. The blow was fatal. I heard later that he ran, crossbow bolts whistling past him as [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin Thaleia]] and [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]] slipped out in the chaos. [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]], ever quick-thinking, telepathically instructed [[People/Party/Pets/Thanatos|Thanatos]] to pass the stolen sigil page to [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin Thaleia]] and [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]] so they could investigate it outside the city.

Back in the conference room, [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]] got word to us that the others had escaped. It was clear we needed to act fast. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] cast Silence on the door, [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]] and I knocked out the guards, and I threw up an illusion to cover our tracks. The escape was anything but smooth - the commanders were strong, and we were knocked down more than once. But we fought our way out. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] bounced away first, finding an inn to hide at until the Seeming wore off. I managed to fly up and over the city walls, with the guards firing volley after volley at me, fortunately, I avoided every shot. [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]], ever clever, made herself invisible while the guards thought she was unconscious, sneaking out when no one was looking.

I can't help but feel a strange mix of pride and exhaustion. We survived, but the city is on high alert, and our investigation into [[People/NPCs/Legendary/Aywin Magleth|Aywin Magleth]]'s lost plans is more complicated than ever. I wonder what consequences will follow, and whether we'll ever be able to return.
