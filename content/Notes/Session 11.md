## Journal Entry

The chaos of the animated kitchen had barely settled when we pressed forward. There was no time to rest; [[Abel Milhaud]] was still somewhere in the [[Pashae Institute]], and we had to find him before it was too late. [[Manmosu]], ever eager, picked the lock to the pantry where [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]] was held. His dramatic entrance was somewhat undercut by the door's stubbornness, but we found the boy inside, pale, weak, and drained of blood. The sight of him, strapped down and punctured like a pin cushion, sent a chill through me. What horrors had they inflicted on him?

As we worked to assess [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]]'s condition, the room revealed more mysteries. Vials of unknown substances lined the shelves, untouched but ominous. [[Lyra Shadowflame|I]] couldn't help but wonder what experiments had been conducted here. Meanwhile, I discovered the mechanism behind the animated cutlery and oven, a delayed spell trap, cleverly hidden but now disarmed. It was a small victory, but the unease lingered.

Then came the footsteps. The door to the institute opened and closed, though no one was visible. [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]], ever quick to act, cast a sleep spell to reveal the intruder, but it failed. A voice called out, demanding we leave [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]] behind. [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]], with her usual flair, told them exactly where they could shove their demands. There was no turning back now.

The battle that followed was chaos incarnate. Fog clouds filled the air, obscuring friend and foe alike. The mages from the institute were formidable, their potions granting them unnatural speed and resilience at the cost of their own bodies. Their spells were a maddening dance of illusions, mirror images, invisibility, and other tricks designed to confuse and frustrate. One mage escaped, vanishing into the ether, while the other fell to [[Gralstak]]'s blade. The death was not clean, her body erupted in a burst of arcane energy, a grim reminder of the cost of their magic.

With [[Abel Milhaud|Abel]] in tow, we fled the scene. [[Manmosu]] carried the boy, his steps careful and deliberate to avoid drawing attention. [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] and [[Manmosu]] worked together to make our escape look inconspicuous, and somehow, we managed to blend into the bustling streets. The [[Organisations/Adventuring Parties/index|Adventurers' League]] headquarters was our sanctuary, at least for now. But the weight of what we had done, and what we had uncovered, hung heavy over us.

The [[Organisations/Pashae Institute|Pashae Institute]] will not forget this. Neither will I.
