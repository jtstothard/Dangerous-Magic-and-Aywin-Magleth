## Journal Entry

The session began with tension in [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]]. The party faced accusations from [[Tango Fowler]] over [[Foxtrot Fowler]]'s death, with emotions running high and blame cast for the lycanthropy affliction. [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] and [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] tried to calm [[Tango Fowler|Tango]], framing the tragedy as a curse, while [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]] took a harsher stance, calling [[Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]] a monster. The mood was somber, and the town kept its distance from us.

In the tavern, we regrouped. Apologies and reintroductions were exchanged, with [[Gralstak]] and [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]] sharing their ages, and [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]] expressing surprise at [[Gralstak]]'s youth. [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] pressed Robin to avoid manipulating people, a request Robin found difficult to accept. The party rested and leveled up, preparing for the journey ahead.

Leaving [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]], we traveled toward [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/index|Aeremore]]. The first day was uneventful, passing a caravan and a small adventuring party. On the second day, a magical fog descended, and we were ambushed by the same adventurers. I was knocked unconscious, and a fierce battle ensued. [[Robin Thaleia|Robin]]'s fey transformation and [[Threecie Novik|Threecie]]'s decisive actions turned the tide. Some enemies exploded into smoke, victims of a botched fog cloud spell.

After the fight, [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] found documents revealing the attackers were contracted by the [[Organisations/Adventuring Parties/index|Aeremore Adventurers' League]] to find missing plans, targeting our party specifically. The session ended with unresolved questions about the contract and the league's motives.
