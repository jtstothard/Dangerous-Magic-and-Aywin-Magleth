## Journal Entry

The aftermath of the attack at the [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/Buildings/Cloudbrow Farm & Barn|Cloudbrow Barn]] left me shaken. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] and [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] examined the corpses, uncovering that most chickens were infected by others, but some bore deliberate bite marks from a larger creature. The infection felt purposeful, not random.

[[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]]'s public declaration using *Thaumaturgy* changed everything. She announced the werewolf threat to all of [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/index|Cerbereburn]], demanding everyone present themselves for inspection. The town's response was immediate, [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Marius Ligroves|Marius]], [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Dhunta Rannacit|Dhunta]], [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Javu Rannacit|Javu]], [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Narchis Cloudbrow|Narchis]], [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Risgex Cloudbrow|Risgex]], [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Syndra Tallbloom|Syndra]], and [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]] all emerged.

The party split to investigate new disturbances. I joined [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]] and [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] to the [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Strondabella Keggranite|Keggronite Residence]], where [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] reluctantly let us in. [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Jafrak Keggranite|Jafrak]] seemed normal, eating dinner, and we found no evidence of supernatural activity. Meanwhile, [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin Thaleia]] and [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] swept the [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/Buildings/Brightroot Apartments|Brightroot Apartments]], finding most doors unresponsive except for [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Risgara Geraves|Risgara]]'s locked door. [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]] blasted open a door, but the room was empty.

Night surveillance began. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] visited the Fowler residence, where [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Tango Fowler|Tango]] claimed ignorance of [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot]]'s whereabouts. [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] camped outside [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Bertrum Greyson|Bertrum Greyson]]'s forge. [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]], [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]], and I watched the apartments, discovering flattened grass but no suspicious activity.

Morning brought new tensions. The [[The Owlbear Cub Tavern]] was eerily empty. [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Marius Ligroves|Marius]] and [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]] arrested me and [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]], claiming it was to keep us available for the investigation. The sense of official suspicion was growing.

A gruesome discovery in the forest confirmed the threat extended beyond chickens. [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Zymis Wenben|Zymis Wenben]] was found mauled, with blood spatter and an open window suggesting a violent struggle. [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Marius Ligroves|Marius]] blocked further investigation, but [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin Thaleia]] managed to infiltrate the room with *Misty Step*, though found little evidence.

Later, [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin Thaleia]] interrogated [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot Fowler]] with *Charm Person*. Foxtrot was shocked about the werechickens and alarmed that we had killed infected creatures, but still concealed something.

The day ended with a confrontation at [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aswesh/Towns/Cerbereburn/Buildings/Greyson Tools|Greyson Tools]]. [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Marius Ligroves|Marius]] tried to arrest [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin Thaleia]] for spellcasting, but [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] intervened, declaring himself lawmaster and carrying Marius away. [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Amara Tallbloom|Amara Tallbloom]] witnessed the scene and later provided her family's alibi for the night of Zymis's death.

So many leads remain: the [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Strondabella Keggranite|Keggronite]] connection, [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Foxtrot Fowler|Foxtrot Fowler]]'s secrets, the fate of [[People/NPCs/Cerbereburn/Mrs Cluckerson|Mrs Cluckerson]], and the true nature of the infection. The town feels on the brink, and I am not sure who to trust.
