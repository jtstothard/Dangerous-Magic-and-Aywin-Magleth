## 🔍 **Potential Next Leads**

**1. Follow up on the Keggronites**
- Try to get a look at their documents or speak more directly with [[Strondabella Keggranite|Strondabella]]
- Investigate their expansion plans and how they interacted with [[Mallone Ulaxidor|Mallone]]
**2. Investigate Foxtrot**
- [[Tango Fowler|Tango]]’s partner who recently returned to town
- They're an outsider who could have been manipulated or paid
**3. Re-interview Risgex and Shayee**
- Now that more info is out, check for inconsistencies
- Especially with the barn incident, someone may have seen or heard something new
**4. Investigate the Barn Itself**
- How were the chickens infected?
- Who would benefit from a distraction like this?
- Does this tie to the murder, or is it a separate problem?
**5. Ask about the knife wound again**
- Could the murder weapon have been magical or otherwise unusual?
**6. Check Mrs Cluckerson’s disappearance**
- If she was taken or let out, who did it and why?
- Was she infected before or after escaping?
**7. Stake out or investigate Brightroot Apartments**
- [[Shayee Cloudbrow|Shayee]] said that if the Keggronites paid someone to do it, it would have been someone from there
