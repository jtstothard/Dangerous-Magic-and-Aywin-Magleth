## 🔍 **Potential Next Leads**

**1. Follow up on the Keggronites**

- Try to get a look at their documents or speak more directly with Strondabella
- Investigate their expansion plans and how they interacted with Mallone

**2. Investigate Foxtrot**

- Tango’s partner who recently returned to town
- Mentioned as an outsider who could have been manipulated or paid

**3. Re-interview Risgex and Shayee**

- Now that more info is out, check for inconsistencies
- Especially with the barn incident, someone may have seen or heard something new

**4. Investigate the Barn Itself**

- How were the chickens infected?
- Who would benefit from a distraction like this?
- Does this tie to the murder, or is it a separate problem?

**5. Ask about the knife wound again**

- Could the murder weapon have been magical or otherwise unusual?
- Ask around more specifically about daggers, not just knives

**6. Check Mrs Cluckerson’s disappearance**

- If she was taken or let out, who did it and why?
- Was she infected before or after escaping?

**7. Stake out or investigate Brightroot Apartments**

- Shayee said that if the Keggronites paid someone to do it, it would have been someone from there
