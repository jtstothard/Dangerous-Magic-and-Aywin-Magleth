## Journal Entry

[[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]]'s dreams have always been strange, but last night was something else. She described a raven, [[Thanatos]], as she calls it, whose anatomy is all wrong, like a bird reimagined by someone who's never seen one. When she awoke, the creature was real, and the rest of us could only stare. [[People/Party/Lyra Shadowflame|Hooty]] hated it. I sketched it, trying to capture the way its feathers seemed made of shadow and how its head opened to speak. There's a gold chain on [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]]'s arm now, trailing off to nothing, and a red spiral on [[Thanatos]]'s leg. I'm not sure what it means, but it feels important.

The morning was tense. [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie]] was shaken, guilt gnawing at her after what happened. I think we all felt it, the weight of a life lost, and the uncertainty of why we're being hunted. We tried to get answers from the survivor, but all we learned was that someone matching our description supposedly stole plans from the [[Organisations/Cirrubi Central Bureaucracy|Cirrubi Central Bureaucracy]]. None of us recognized the crest or the plans. It feels like we're being set up. The survivor escaped while we argued, leaving us with more questions and a sense of helplessness.

[[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/index|Aeremore]] is colder than I imagined. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] went straight to the cathedral, seeking answers from [[Allabyra Crisella]] about the symbol we found in [[Bertrum Greyson]]'s house and the smoky people. She was told to speak to [[Deacon Cain]] and [[Deacon Cathetos]], one for symbology, one for magical mutations. The rest of us ended up at [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie Novik]]'s place. It's sparse, barely lived in, but it was enough. [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin Thaleia]] and [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie Novik]] shared a drink, while [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] and I played cards, and for a moment, things felt almost normal.

Today, we went to the [[Organisations/Adventuring Parties/index|Aeremore Adventurers' League]]. [[Maccario Bulen|Maccario]], a dwarven official, offered us a contract to find the missing plans if we could pass their test. We registered as [[The Prime Suspects]]. I'm not sure if it's a joke or a warning, but it's ours now. There are so many threads, [[Thanatos]], the stolen plans, the symbols, and the smoky people. I don't know where they lead, but I'll keep following them. For now, I'm just glad we're together, even if everything feels uncertain.
