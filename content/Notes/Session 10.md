## Journal Entry

The day began with a surprise reunion. [[People/Party/Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]], ever the investigator, was poking around the [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/Buildings/Pashae Institute|Pashae Institute]] when she stumbled upon [[People/Party/Manmosu|Manmosu]], lounging in a hotel dressing gown with a cup of tea. Their conversation was brief but filled with updates. [[Manmosu]] seemed amused by our ongoing investigation, while [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]], ever cautious, tried to blend in by borrowing the dressing gown to cover her vestments.

Meanwhile, the rest of us gathered at the [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/Buildings/Cathedral|Cathedral]], waiting for [[Lharamit Pirevin Rhyne|Lharamit]] to return. The tension was palpable as we discussed our next steps. When she finally arrived with [[Manmosu]] in tow, we decided to scout the [[Places/Continents/Jealeon/Regions/Aeremore/Buildings/Pashae Institute|Pashae Institute]]. [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Threecie's]] companion, [[People/Party/Threecie Novik|Thanatos]], invisibly flew ahead to investigate. He discovered an abandoned kitchen and, behind a locked door, the unconscious form of [[Abel Milhaud|Abel Milhaud]]. It was clear he was being experimented on.

The group debated how to proceed. [[People/Party/Robin Thaleia|Robin]] suggested charm magic, while [[People/Party/Gralstak|Gralstak]] and [[People/Party/Lyra Shadowflame|I]] preferred a more direct approach so we applied for access through the [[Clerk Cloudy Vogelveid|Clerk]], specifically trying to gain access to magic that protects against mind magic and infiltrate buildings. Ultimately, [[Manmosu]] attempted to sneak in through a window but triggered a pressure plate, activating enchanted kitchenware. The stealth plan fell apart as we charged in to rescue him, battling animated cutlery and a hostile oven. Chaos ensued, but we managed to regroup and prepare for the next steps.
