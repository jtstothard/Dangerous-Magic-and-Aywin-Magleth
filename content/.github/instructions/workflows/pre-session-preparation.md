# Pre-Session Recap Workflow

## Overview

This workflow helps you prepare a concise, bullet-pointed "previously on" summary to remind everyone at the table where the last session left off. The goal is to provide a quick, clear refresher at the start of each session, similar to the opening of an episodic TV show.


## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Create the Next Session File**
   - Make a new note for the upcoming session (e.g., `Session X.md`) in your session notes folder.
   - Optionally, copy the recap template or structure from previous sessions.

2. **Review the Previous Session Note**
   - Read through the last session's summary and major events.
   - Identify the most important plot points, unresolved mysteries, and character actions.

3. **Draft a Brief Recap**
   - Write a short list of bullet points (ideally 3–7) that capture:
     - Key events and turning points
     - Unresolved threads or immediate next steps
     - Any major character or party developments
   - Keep each point concise and factual—avoid unnecessary detail or narrative embellishment.

4. **Share the Recap at the Table**
   - Read the bullet points aloud at the start of the session, or share them in your group chat/notes.
   - Optionally, include the recap at the top of the new session note for reference.

## Tips

- Focus on what the party needs to remember to jump back in quickly.
- If in doubt, prioritise unresolved hooks and immediate goals.
- Keep the recap brief—aim for clarity and momentum, not completeness.
