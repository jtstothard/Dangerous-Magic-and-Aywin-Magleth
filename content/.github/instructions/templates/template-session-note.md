## Journal Entry



> **Note:**
>
> - Replace the emoji in the title with one that fits the session's theme or mood (e.g., 🦉 for an owlbear encounter, 🕵️ for a mystery session).
> - The session title should read like a TV episode title—evocative, memorable, and relevant to the session's events.

Write this section as if it were a personal journal entry written by Lyra, reflecting on the session from her perspective. The tone should be introspective and narrative, capturing her thoughts, emotions, and observations about the events that unfolded. Include:

1. **Introduction**: Describe the starting point of the session, including the setting, the group's mood, and Lyra's initial thoughts or concerns.
2. **Key Events**: Narrate the major events in detail, focusing on what happened, who was involved, and how Lyra perceived or reacted to these moments. Highlight any significant decisions, conflicts, or discoveries.
3. **Character Contributions**: Reflect on how each character contributed to the session, including their actions, decisions, and any personal developments, as seen through Lyra's eyes.
4. **NPC Interactions**: Summarize important interactions with NPCs, including their roles, motivations, and any new information revealed, while incorporating Lyra's interpretation of their behavior or intentions.
5. **Cliffhangers or Unresolved Threads**: Conclude with Lyra's thoughts on any unresolved mysteries, cliffhangers, or leads, and her feelings about what might come next.

The entry should feel personal and immersive, providing a vivid recounting of the session while offering insight into Lyra's perspective and emotional state. It can also include details about things that Lyra didn't necessarily witness but learned about through others.
